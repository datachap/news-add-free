            <p>The gates of the Burning Hells have opened once more, welcoming more of Lilith’s children home. Diablo IV is a game about slaying nightmarish creatures and acquiring powerful gear, but also about forging memories with new and old friends. We want to break down barriers to make it easier for wanderers everywhere to defend Sanctuary. Which is why we’re honored to announce…Diablo IV will be available to play on Steam starting October 17! The Diablo IV Steam page is live now, and the game is available to wishlist. Diablo IV’s presence on Steam is in addition to Battle.net, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4, so wanderers playing the game on any existing platform need not make any changes. Those wanting to play on Steam will need to first purchase the game on that platform, then connect Diablo IV to a Battle.net account (as we require for all platforms). This enables cross-platform play and more. Players using Steam will have access to features specific to that platform, such as Steam achievements, their Steam friends list, and the option to invite those friends to play in-game. We’re looking forward to seeing more defenders of Sanctuary band together and welcome any feedback you may have. The timing of Diablo IV’s launch on Steam couldn’t be better! It coincides with the release of Season of Blood, our second Season, which introduces a new Questline for you to uncover, Vampiric Powers to wield with terrifying lethality, 5 additional endgame bosses, and more. To get a full overview of the upcoming Season of Blood, visit this article or catch up on our Developer Update Livestream that occurred today.</p>

The company reported $177 million in net revenue, up 15% year over year, for its fiscal first quarter. Its cannabis division brought in $70 million in net revenue, reflecting a 20% spike year over year. It also narrowed its net loss to $55.9 million during the quarter, compared to a loss of $65.8 million a year earlier. Tilray is a multinational cannabis company based in Canada, but it has increasingly moved into other segments, particularly the U.S. craft beer industry, as it navigates an uncertain legal environment for marijuana around the world. The company said it grew cannabis revenue in Canada by 16.5% and strengthened its leading market share position in the country to 13.4%. Canada is one of the few major markets where recreational cannabis is legal at the federal level. On an earnings call Wednesday, CEO Irwin Simon said the company's recent beverage mergers and acquisitions will accelerate growth and expand the company's footprint beyond its recreational cannabis business as the drug remains illegal in key markets in the world, including at the federal level in the U.S. and in much of Europe. "We're waiting for legalization to happen in the U.S.," Simon said separately during an appearance on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Wednesday. "If it happens, it will be great and we're well-positioned." If legalization in the U.S. doesn't happen, Simon said the company will fall back on its booming beverage business. In recent years, the company has been on a buying spree, making deals in what it said are fast-growing markets, such as craft beers and cannabis-infused beverages. Earlier this week, Tilray completed its acquisition of eight beer brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev that it had announced over the summer. The company said the deal makes it the fifth largest in the U.S. craft beer market. Around the same time, the company acquired the remaining 57.5% equity ownership of cannabis-infused drinks maker Truss Beverage from Molson Coors Canada. The transaction prices of both deals were not disclosed. Tilray's beverage alcohol revenue jumped 17% to $24 million in its first quarter, from $21 million in the prior-year period. It cited in part growth in its Montauk Brewing Company subsidiary. Tilray acquired Montauk, a fast-growing brewer in metro New York, in 2022. "We have strategically diversified our company globally over the past several years and, as a result, Tilray is now ideally positioned to capture a wide range of opportunities across multiple industries," said Simon in the earnings release.

Canada's largest cannabis producer, Aurora Cannabis, has long enjoyed a strong presence in the medical marijuana market, which is worth more than C$400m (US$300m; £243m) a year to the company's bottom line. The chief executive of Canadian cannabis company Tilray, Steve Simon, has said the company is "well-positioned" for future growth, despite the fact that the drug remains illegal in the United States and much of the rest of the world, as well as in Canada. Shares of Canadian cannabis firm Tilray fell as much as 20% in after-hours trading on Friday after the company said it would sell its cannabis-infused drinks business for $450m (£300m) to private equity firm Cerberus. Canadian cannabis firm Tilray (TLRY) has expanded its beverage alcohol business by buying US-based Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and its Canadian subsidiary, Tilray Brewing Co., in two separate deals, including a ship of cannabis-infused drinks maker Truss Beverage. Simon Property Group, one of the world's largest owners and developers of shopping centres, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, helped by strong demand for its malls in the US " Simon Property Group is well-positioned to deliver strong returns to shareholders over the long term.
