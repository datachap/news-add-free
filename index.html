        <p  class="element-article">Unsealed testimony reveals that Apple considered mounting a challenge against Google in search by acquiring Microsoft’s search engine Bing, in a rare glimpse of the behind-the-scenes maneuvering in an industry dominated by Google. A Washington, D.C. court unsealed the testimony of an Apple senior vice president, John Giannandrea, on Wednesday after public criticism that too much of a landmark antitrust trial against Google was taking place behind closed doors. Apple lawyers had argued against the necessity of Giannandrea taking the stand, and had pushed for much of the details about Apple’s business with Google to be sealed on grounds of trade secrets. The trial has helped clarify why so few tech giants have seriously tried to compete with Google in the search sector, where Google maintains a steady 90 percent market share. Apple had indeed considered the possibility, according to Giannandrea’s testimony, but had abandoned the idea to continue a lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Google. Other major smartphone makers also maintain similar agreements with Google. Equity research firm Sanford Bernstein estimates that Google will pay Apple up to $19 billion this year to set Google search as the default on iPhones and other devices, in a pact that Apple’s executives have rarely discussed in public. The unsealing of the Apple transcript has been widely anticipated by trial watchers, after Judge Amit Mehta announced it days earlier. Giannandrea had originally testified for only around 10 minutes publicly before the rest of his session was sealed. The Google trial is the Justice Department’s first antitrust case against a major tech company in more than two decades. The hearings had drawn blowback for their secrecy, before Mehta and Google reversed course to make more of the testimony public. Giannandrea’s testimony reflects that extensive consideration took place within Apple about whether they could take on Google by launching their own search engine. For one thing, he said, Apple had begun peeling off a modest number of search queries from its Safari search engine by “intercepting” them with its “Safari Suggestions” feature, instead of passing all the queries straight to Google. “The way I think about it is that we are getting the first bite at the apple, so to speak,” Giannandrea said on the stand Sept. 22. “We’re intercepting every query you’re trying to do and trying to decide whether we can help.” Giannandrea also said Apple met with Microsoft in 2018 to discuss the possibility of acquiring its Bing search engine. He said the talks were closely held at the time, as “it’s hard to operate something if you know you’re about to be sold.” A Bing acquisition, a joint venture with Microsoft and other options, were presented to Apple CEO Tim Cook in a slide deck at the time. Giannandrea said that, after evaluating their options, he came to the “definitive opinion” that Apple should not proceed with an acquisition of Bing. Cook told Microsoft they were rejecting the deal. The transcript also reflected Apple leveraging Microsoft’s Bing as a bargaining chip as it negotiated its revenue-share agreement with Google. “We build them [Microsoft] up, create incremental negotiating leverage to keep the take rate from Google, and further our optionality to replace Google down the line,” Adrian Perica, an Apple vice president, wrote in an internal email that a Justice Department prosecutor read aloud at the trial.</p>

        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Samsung Electronics today announced the Galaxy SmartTag2, launching globally on October 11. The SmartThings Find app has also been upgraded, with newly registered Galaxy SmartTags that now installs a shortcut to the app on the user’s smartphone. Users can now enjoy Galaxy Smart Tag2 for longer with the brand-new Power Saving Mode, available alongside an improved Normal mode. The battery life is now extended to 500 days, a 50% increase on previous models. Samsung remains committed to securing the privacy of Galaxy users. This feature alerts users of any unauthorized tracking by sending them a notification if an unknown SmartTag detects them following them. For Samsung Galaxy users, Find can also provide security alerts through its “Unknown tag” feature, which hides the message left by the owner from the device.</p>
        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">Samsung Newsroom's videos will no longer be supported on Internet Explorer. Please try a different type of web browser.    Samsung Electronics today announced the Galaxy SmartTag2, launching globally on October 11. Galaxy SmartTag2 brings enhancements to the Galaxy SmartTag line that enable new and better ways to keep track of valuables. Upgrades to the design and usability create even more use cases for the device than ever before.   “We are constantly looking at ways to make people’s lives more convenient through Samsung Galaxy’s industry-leading innovations,” said Jaeyeon Jung, Executive Vice President and Head of SmartThings, Device Platform Center at Samsung Electronics. “With the Galaxy SmartTag2, we set out to make sure Samsung Galaxy users can find their belongings in an easy and intuitive way. With an enhanced finding experience and a longer battery life, Galaxy SmartTag2 will provide users with greater peace of mind for longer and in more situations.”     Galaxy SmartTag2’s brand-new Lost Mode2 allows users to input their contact information via a message. Then, anyone who discovers an item with a Galaxy SmartTag2 attached can use their smartphone to scan the tag and see the owners’ message and contact information. This means a Galaxy SmartTag2 attached to a pet’s collar is now a convenient way to ensure the pet owner’s phone number is always there, in most places where the pet might wander. Lost Mode works with any mobile device with NFC reader and web browser.   Galaxy SmartTag2 now provides an improved Compass View feature, enhancing the user experience by providing arrows to show the direction and distance of the Galaxy SmartTag2 in relation to the user. This mode is available on any UWB-supported Galaxy smartphone, such as the Galaxy S23 Ultra.3   The SmartThings Find app has also been upgraded, with newly registered Galaxy SmartTags that now installs a shortcut to the app on the user’s smartphone, allowing users to launch SmartThings Find more quickly. Additionally, the app now features a full screen map view and an intuitive interface, making the user experience even more seamless.   Finally, when switching Galaxy smartphones, SmartTag2 now automatically re-syncs you’re your now Galaxy smartphone using your Samsung account.     Users can now enjoy Galaxy SmartTag2 for longer with the brand-new Power Saving Mode, available alongside an improved Normal mode. For users who rely on SmartTag to continually track items, Power Saving Mode is the perfect option to maintain battery life while ensuring you can keep an eye on your things. With Power Saving Mode, Galaxy SmartTag2’s battery now lasts up to 700 days, more than twice as long as previous Galaxy SmartTag models. Even in Normal Mode, battery life is now extended to 500 days, a 50% increase on previous models. With the flexibility to switch between two modes, users can track their valuables — from car keys to bikes — for longer.     Galaxy SmartTag2’s new compact size and ring-shaped design was created with ease of use in mind. The large metal loop enhances product durability by using metal on the inside of the ring for greater resilience that can support accessories such as clips and keyrings. These accessories can also attach to bags and luggage.   Galaxy SmartTag2’s durability has also been upgraded with an IP675 rating for water and dust resistance. This enables users to track their items in even more challenging environments, such as when travelling outdoors. For pet owners, there’s no need to worry about everyday wear and tear on the device from pet’s water bowls or running around outside.   Galaxy SmartTag2 also supports a new pet walking mode, making it easy for users to log walks with their furry friends.     Galaxy SmartTag2 retains many of the popular features from Galaxy SmartTag and Galaxy SmartTag+. It takes advantage of both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and UWB capabilities, leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) Find technology to visually guide users toward their item using their Samsung Galaxy smartphone camera. In addition, Galaxy SmartTag2 works within maximum Bluetooth range of 120 meters and can control smart home appliances through the SmartThings app.   Samsung remains committed to securing the privacy of Samsung Galaxy users, with the device’s location only to be made available with the user’s permission. SmartThings Find also encrypts user data and is supported by Samsung Knox for an extra layer of security. Furthermore, disabling Lost Mode immediately hides the owners’ contact information and wipes the message left by the owner from the device.   For Samsung Galaxy users, SmartThings Find can also provide security through its “Unknown tag alerts” feature. This feature alerts users of any unauthorized tracking by sending them a notification if SmartThings Find detects an unknown SmartTag following them. This helps protect users and prevent against the abuse of location tracking services.   Galaxy SmartTag2 also works seamlessly with SmartThings Station, which is integrated with SmartThings Find — serving as an always-at-home device scanner — helping users keep track of valuables that have a SmartTag attached. SmartThings Station will notify users of the location of their tagged item — from personal items like TV remotes, wallets, keys and registered devices like smartphones, tablets, watches and earbuds. Pet owners will also receive an alert when a tagged collar moves too far from the SmartThings Station, helping them keep furry friends close to home.     1 For Galaxy SmartTag2, Samsung account log-in and registration on SmartThings Find is required. Galaxy SmartTag2 needs to be paired with ultra-wideband (UWB)-enabled Galaxy smartphones with Android 11 or higher to fully function. Accuracy may be reduced if there’s an obstacle between you and the tag, such as when the tag is inside a drawer, behind a wall or in a car. 2 Contact information and message shown on Lost Mode must be registered beforehand on the SmartThings app. 3 Current Galaxy products that support UWB include Galaxy Note20 Ultra, Galaxy S21+, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S22+, Galaxy S22 Ultra, Galaxy S23+, Galaxy S23 Ultra, Galaxy Z Fold2, Z Fold3, Z Fold4 and Z Fold5. 4 Battery life is based on results from internal lab tests for typical usage pattern scenarios conducted by Samsung. Tested with results from a pre-release version of the device using inbox CR2032 battery. Actual battery life may vary depending on different usage patterns, device model or the battery manufacturer. 5 Galaxy SmartTag2 is rated as IP67. Based on lab test conditions for submersion in up to 1 meter of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. Not advised for beach, pool use or soapy water. Water and dust resistance of device is not permanent and may diminish over time.

        <p  class="element-article">Filed under: The Keywords Studios workers were laid off in late September All of Keywords Studios’ unionized QA workers were laid off from the studio in late September after Dragon Age: Dreadwolf developer BioWare declined to continue its contract in August.  The QA workers, who were contracted to assist with playtesting and quality assurance at BioWare Edmonton, won their union vote in June 2022. All 16 eligible voters said “yes” to joining United Food and Commercial Workers Canada Union, Local No. 401. It was a historic vote, making the group the first games industry union in Canada. Keywords Studios workers were in bargaining with the company when they were laid off following the news of 50 job cuts at BioWare itself. A UFCW representative told Polygon that 13 people were laid off — everyone supporting BioWare. Liz Corless, Keywords Studios’ global head of marketing, confirmed that 13 Edmonton-based QA workers were laid off. “We can confirm that regrettably the 13 Edmonton-based staff have now left the business following the end of a fixed term client contract,” Corless wrote in an email. The group of workers were laid off on Sept. 27. James Russwurm, a former Keywords QA tester, added that Keywords Studios has “taken the position there is no more work available.” (Keywords Studios has several QA job postings listed on its website, in Canada and across the world. Many, but not all of these listings, are related to language localization and require specialties that the laid-off workers may not have.) Russwurm said the union filed an employment standards complaint against Keywords Studios this week. He added that Keywords Studios offered “minimal severance,” which the union is disputing. Severance has not yet been paid out, he said. (Several BioWare employees laid off at that time are currently suing the company for “adequate severance.” These are two separate issues with two separate companies, however, despite being linked to Dragon Age: Dreadwolf.) Though the unionized QA workers did not yet have a contract with Keywords Studios, they can attempt to negotiate better severance pay. Keywords Studios is headquartered in Ireland but has more than 20 worldwide offices. The studio was founded in 1998, and does not publish or develop its own games — instead, it provides art, QA, audio, and other development support for other studios, like BioWare.

        <h2><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/gmail-unsubscribe-option-bulk-senders/">Gmail will soon introduce a straightforward unsubscribe option to block bulk senders - Android Police</a></h2>
        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Gmail will require bulk email senders to have a single-buttoned opt-out option. Companies can send as many emails as they want, but Gmail has implemented a threshold of 5,000 daily emails sent. The new move is meant to choke-hold spoof emails and protect users from spam. Legitimate companies will have a blue checkmark alongside their names. However, the spoofed checkmarks seen in June demonstrate that maintaining security will require ongoing effort from Google. The aim is not to completely eradicate spammers – that would be too ambitious. The game keeps intensifying, so Gmail may need to remain vigilant to make its service safer. Still, the latest blue-check verification system is high-tier and could reduce spam prevalence to a bigger percentage than previous measures.</p>
        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">Users will be able to scrap junk messages with a single click Gmail has been a go-to for most companies, clients, and end-users for almost two decades. And there are a bunch of reasons why folks just won’t stop holding on — the email service has been surfing on the waves of technological advancements to ramp up communication and marketing, and it's preinstalled on all the best Chromebooks and top Android phones, to name a few. Its leading position doesn’t leave much room for loopholes, though. That’s why the email service will always jump in when something is getting exploited, even when it means exacting harsh crackdowns. Spammers have gotten away with their schemes on Gmail for a while now despite previous corrective measures. But the loose knots are being tightened in 2024, as announced by the service. Soon, Gmail will require bulk email senders to have a single-buttoned opt-out option. The opt-out button should be clear and easy to find for users who aren’t interested in receiving certain messages. Companies can send as many emails as they want, but Gmail has implemented a threshold of 5,000 daily emails sent, after which the entity gets categorized as a bulk sender and becomes affected by this new crackdown. Effective 2024, the new move is meant to choke-hold spoof emails and protect users from spam. While Gmail had previously employed useful tools to detect spam and clear massive email lists, the new move will spare users from reading those messages at all, as they won’t have to scroll to the end of the messages to find the unsubscribe button. And according to the announcement, the unsubscribe request should take no more than two days to process. Besides its generative AI spam detection tool, Gmail is trying to decrease unwanted messages by giving legitimate email senders blue verification checkmarks. If spam escapes the AI’s sharp radar, it will be easily identified as phishy for lack of the verification checkmark. Well, these are all efforts to tighten the loose ends and eliminate creative spammers, but effectiveness remains to be seen, as spammers have already found ways to spoof these checkmarks. Still, the latest blue-check verification system is high-tier and could reduce spam prevalence to a bigger percentage than previous measures. Inspired by Twitter (now X), the verification system focuses on full-fledged companies; individual users might not be shielded. Legitimate companies will have a blue checkmark alongside their names. However, the spoofed checkmarks seen in June demonstrate that maintaining security will require ongoing effort from Google. The aim is not to completely eradicate spammers – that would be too ambitious. However, rolling out these operations gradually elevates user protection. The game keeps intensifying, so Gmail may need to remain vigilant to make its service safer.

        <p  class="element-article">If your Android phone supports Android 14, you can download the OS today.    Google has released the stable version of Android 14. Google announced the release of Android 14, alongside the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro phones, on Wednesday during the Made by Google event. The Android 14 software update is rolling out to supported devices. The latest major release of the Android mobile operating system brings new features to your Android smartphone, including AI-generated wallpapers, passkeys for third-party apps, monthly reminders for data-sharing, and camera flash notifications.

The general public release of Android 14 was originally slated for early September but was ultimately pushed back until today. During today's Made by Google event, in addition to the new Pixels, the company also unveiled the Pixel Watch 2 and the latest Pixel Buds Pro -- all of which you can preorder. Don't miss: Google Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, Watch 2: Everything Google Just Announced If you're interested in testing Android 14, here's everything you need to know, including the biggest new features, whether your phone supports Android 14, and if so, how to download Android 14 onto your device. Android 14 doesn't revolutionize the Android experience so much as push the mobile operating system forward, but it does now offer AI-generated wallpapers, passkeys for third-party apps, dynamic monochromatic themes and more. Mostly there are enhancements: camera, accessibility, home screen, lock screen, privacy and security, and battery optimization all are improved with Android 14. The camera gets several improvements with Android 14, including support for high-quality Ultra HDR images, better low-light photography on compatible phones and in-sensor zooming that allows you to zoom in and out without loss of image quality in some third-party apps. A new document scanner service will allow apps to digitize physical documents, like your receipts, with your camera. For accessibility, Android 14 offers larger fonts, scaled up to 200%, for those who are visually impaired. There are also camera flash notifications -- which use your camera's flash to notify you -- meant for people who are hard of hearing. You can pinch-to-zoom to set magnification in your apps. And there are more customization settings for hearing aids. The lock screen features a new customization picker, with custom clocks and lock screen shortcuts. And for privacy and security, you have notifications warning you of any changed data-sharing practices for third-party apps, stricter app permissions, enhanced PIN privacy, ability to disable 2G connectivity, encryption for all cellular connections and more. Every Android phone out there supports the Android OS -- but not in the same way.  Google usually develops a new Android update, known simply as Android OS, and then releases it to its own devices, like the Pixel Pro, Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet. Other smartphone manufacturers then transform the stock Android OS into their own update, or skin -- Samsung has One UI and OnePlus has OxygenOS, for example. As for pure Android 14, only a limited number of Google devices support the latest Android OS: Android 14-based updates will be pushed out to devices from Samsung, Nothing, OnePlus, Sony and other manufacturers later this year. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro will ship with Android 14. On your supported Android, go into the Settings application, scroll down to the bottom and tap System > System update. If Android 14 is available on your device, you'll see your update status appear. If not, tap the Check for update button at the bottom. Next, hit Download and install and wait for your phone to download the latest software and restart. Once your phone boots back up, you should see Android 14 running. Note: If you see a "not enough space available" notification, you'll need to free up storage before you can update to Android 14. Android 14 running on a Pixel 6 Pro.

        <p  class="element-article">The new Pixel phones are here with brighter screens, better cameras, and much smarter brain After months of leaks, Google finally officially launched the Google Pixel 8 series today at an event in New York. While the phones look similar to the last generation of Pixels, and camera hardware improvements are modest, there is a new Tensor G3 chip that promises to do big things. Essentially, Google is marketing the Pixel 8 phones as the first mobile handsets to run generative AI on device. These new phones, especially the more capable Pixel 8 Pro, are no doubt going to be among the best smartphones of the year. Correction: an earlier version of this article erroneously stated the Pixel 8 series' main camera sensor as the GN2 when it is the GNV. We apologize for the error. Let's start with the overall hardware changes first, because this part will be quick. The most noticeable physical difference comes in the Pixel 8 Pro — the 6.7-inch OLED screen is now entirely flat, a departure from the curved panels of the last two Pro Pixels. The edges of the screen blends into the aluminum frame seamlessly with a very subtle chamfered edge, so it doesn't feel sharp and pointy the way iPhone 12, 13 and 14 series do. Whether it's weight or dimensions, the Pixel 8 Pro feels nearly identical to last year's 7 Pro. The smaller standard Pixel 8 actually downsized to a 6.1-inch screen from last year's 6.2, and as a result the phone is actually 10g lighter, at 182. Both Pixel 8 phone display panels are brighter than last year, with the standard 8 screen reaching a peak brightness of 2,000 nits while the 8 Pro can get up to 2,400 nits. The Pro screen is also an LTPO panel with refresh rate between 1-120Hz, while the standard display can do 60Hz or 120Hz. Both the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro main cameras upgrades to the Samsung ISOCELL GN2 GNV sensor (previous generations were on GN1). This is "new" only if we're talking Pixels, because the GNV sensor has been around for two years and were used in several 2022 Chinese Android flagships including the Vivo X80 Pro. The GNV has a sensor size of 1/1.3-inch. Google says the main camera can take in 21% more light than the Pixel 7 main cameras. The Pixel 8 Pro's two other cameras also got hardware upgrades: the Periscope zoom lens has a faster aperture, while the ultra-wide camera is high-res, at 48MP compared to last year's 12MP. These upgrades did not make it over to the standard Pixel 8, which stuck with the same ultra-wide and doesn't have a zoom lens at all. The Pixel 8 Pro also has a new temperature sensor that can be used to check temperature of food and other items. Google says it has applied to the FDA to use the sensor for body temperature scanning in the future. When I reviewed the Pixel 7 last year I called it "the smartest smartphone," because of all the unique things Tensor G2 could do, such as eerily accurate voice dictation and on-device Google Assistant. The Tensor G3 is obviously a more capable chip, but how much? While Google didn't mention any direct comparison against the Tensor G2, the company did say the Tensor G3 runs twice as many machine learning algorithms as the first Tensor chip (used in the Pixel 6 phones). The Tensor G3, as mentioned, allows the Pixel phones to run on-device generative AI, meaning the chip can generate data and images on its own, without the cloud. This results in superior features, like Magic Editor, which allows the user to move a subject's position in a photo, and have generative AI fill in the missing pixels. While I didn't get to try that during the brief demo time, I did try another new feature: "Best Take," which allows you to swap faces of a person in a group photo, provided you took more than one image. For example, I took five selfies with XDA's editor-in-chief Rich earlier, and each selfie I made a different facial expression. The Pixel 8 phones allows me to swap out my facial expression from one selfie onto the other, and the results are surprisingly clean. There's also "Audio Magic Eraser," which will apparently use machine learning to remove unwanted background noise. Generative AI will also benefit general smartphone tasks outside the cameras. If you type a paragraph on Gboard, you can have Google's AI examine the text and suggest different words or phrases with a tap. The Pixel 8 phones can also quickly scan through an article and then provide you with a summary. Google says the Tensor G3 is more efficient too. Let's hope so, because the Tensor G2 chip ran warm often, particularly on the Pixel Fold. So while the Pixel 8 phones do not bring a lot new in terms of tangible, visible hardware, the promises that generative AI can bring is a big deal and could change how we use phones going forward. It is worth asking if Google's AI-assisted photo editing tools are veering too close to uncanny valley territory. With Magic Editor, the phone makes it very easy to doctor photos, and create photos that aren't even based in reality. But I suppose that's been a question most of us have been having about the rise of generative AI in the past year. We will be back with a full review of both the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro soon. The Pixel 8 Pro is the latest flagship from Google, and it packs the best the company has to offer in 2023. It features the newest Tensor G3 processor, like its regular Pixel 8 sibling, but it comes with a 6.7-inch OLED display, a brighter screen, a larger battery, and more storage options. The Google Pixel 8 boasts of the company's new Tensor G3 processor and features a refined glass and aluminum design. Compared to the Pixel 7, it has a brighter display, a larger battery with quicker charging, and upgraded cameras.  Hello, I'm a senior editor at XDA, covering mostly mobile hardware.

        <p>Google is on trial in Washington, D.C. on whether its search dominance is a violation of antitrust law. The trial has given us some remarkable looks inside the strategic thinking of some normally opaque tech giants. For the first time in a long while, a distant twinkling of a possibility that Google’s search dominance could take a meaningful dent. But Google search is by far the No. 1 source of external traffic to news sites, and any meaningful competition for that title could shake the foundations of the industry. The real path to real search competition in the United States is the most likely to be with Apple, which controls the entire operating system and device market in the U.S. and around the world. It’d be a much better wager than I wager that Google can’t offer a better product than it does.</p>
        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">Google’s on trial in Washington, D.C. Not metaphorically, either: A federal court is almost halfway through what’s expected to be 10 weeks of testimony on whether Google’s search dominance is a violation of U.S. antitrust law. The primary issue involves Google’s multi-billion-dollar deals with browser makers — the ones that make Google their users’ default search engine — and whether they are an unfair barrier to competition. (According to the Justice Department, about half of all Google searches come from a browser the company pays to be the default — and about half of all the rest come from Chrome, which Google owns.) The trial thus far has given us some remarkable looks inside the strategic thinking of some normally opaque tech giants. On Monday, we had Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledging his company’s Bing is no match for Google in quality. “Defaults are the only thing that matter,” Nadella testified, “in terms of changing user behavior.” The most important of those defaults is set by one company: Apple. Nadella testified that he’d offered Apple up to $15 billion a year to switch Safari’s default to Bing — even saying he’d be willing to hide all Bing branding and let Apple brand the search engine as its own.  But Google pays Apple plenty to head off that possibility. (The size of Google’s current annual payment to Apple is not public — both companies claim it’s a trade secret — but reports have suggested it’s north of $15 billion, perhaps approaching $20 billion.) All of this has unfolded amid reporting that Apple has invested huge amounts of money into building its own search engine tech — some of which is used inside current Apple apps but which could evolve into a full-blown search engine.  How will Judge Amit Mehta rule once all the testimony is in? Who knows? But there is, for the first time in a long while, a distant twinkling of a possibility that Google’s search dominance could take a meaningful dent. (Mehta could force Google to stop buying browser default status with all those billions. Or to sell off its dominant Chrome browser. Or to allow other search engines access to its mountain of search data. Or, of course, he could say Google’s dominance is perfectly fine and change nothing.) This is all important stuff which, as Tim Wu writes, “will effectively establish the rules governing tech competition for the next decade, including the battle over commercialized artificial intelligence, as well as newer technologies we cannot yet envision.” But — to be parochial for a moment — what sort of an impact would any movement in this direction have on the news business? That’ll depend on the remedy, obviously. But Google search is by far the No. 1 source of external traffic to news sites, and any meaningful competition for that title could shake the foundations of the industry. To be clear, we’re in thought-experiment territory: Google will be the dominant search engine for the near-to-medium future and any real shift is at least years away. But here are a few of the possibilities. Apple is in an extraordinary and unique position when it comes to search, needing only to flip a switch in Safari to become the biggest non-Google search company of the past two decades. Its iPhones make up a majority of all smartphones in the United States and large shares of most European countries, along with small-to-medium shares around the world. Around 35% of all web browsing (mobile and desktop) in the U.S. and 20% in Europe and worldwide happens in Safari. By making Sherlock (or whatever Apple would call it) the default search engine in Safari, a large share of those users would be immediately switched into it.  Would some switch back to Google? Of course — some, maybe even most. When Apple decided to build its own Maps app to replace Google Maps back in 2012, reviews were terrible — but over time, Apple Maps has become a strong competitor. That’s the worse-case scenario: If Apple ever decides to launch a search engine, I’d wager it’ll a much better Day 1 product than Maps was. And while Google can offer integrations between search and its other products (Gmail, Gcal, Google Maps, and so on), Apple can offer a deeper list of its own, since it controls the entire operating system and device.  That, to me, is the most likely path to real search competition in the United States. Apple’s users are unusually attractive to advertisers because they are, on average, more affluent, and more interested in buying things. (And more interested in reading news online.) So even if an Apple Sherlock didn’t become No. 1 in market share, it would punch above its weight. The key reality for individual publishers vis à vis Google has long been that they have zero power in the relationship. Sure, they could decide to remove their site from Google’s search index if they don’t like the grand content-for-traffic bargain the company offers. But in the real world, pulling out of Google only hurts the publisher. Google will be fine without The Daily Gazette’s stories; The Daily Gazette won’t be fine without Google’s traffic. Would that change if there were two big search engines in town? The internet user in me hates the idea of the web being split among multiple search engines — certain results being a Google exclusive or Apple exclusive. But both would no doubt try to differentiate themselves from each other. Think of how Apple Music has invested in exclusive albums, live performances, and programming to distinguish itself from Spotify. Or how Spotify spent more than $1 billion on podcasts to distinguish itself from Apple Music. Those strategies sometimes work and sometimes don’t — but they do often involve shoveling money at the people making the content.  Would an Apple search engine, say, consider paying a small fraction of a search’s ad revenue to the site that a user clicks onto — the site that, in effect, won the user’s attention? Google would never consider such an idea because, well, it has no incentive to. (Keeping all the money works fine for them!) But if a new player (with $167 billion in cash sitting around) thought it would gain market share, could something like that sound interesting? That may sound far-fetched — heck, it likely is far-fetched! — but this is a unique moment in the relationship between the tech giants and publishers because of two letters: AI. Building a search engine involves spidering the entire internet — finding every webpage you can and copying their contents into a massive search index, all so some later user can type “what was matlock’s first name” into their browser and be told it’s Ben. American courts have held that all this ingesting and copying is nonetheless legal under copyright law because it counts as a “transformative” fair use. A few decades later, along comes AI. Like a search engine, building a large-language model involves ingesting an enormous amount of stuff in order for the AI model to “learn” the stuff’s contents. Does that sort of massive copying count also count as a “transformative” fair use? The courts haven’t decided that one yet. But it seems the main AI companies are getting ahead of the problem — agreeing, in concept, that some publishers should be able to sell the right to use their content in AI training. Some deals have already been struck.  Satya Nadella referenced this in his testimony. Here’s The Verge’s David Pierce: While Nadella said AI has the potential to shake up the market a bit, he also believes it could further entrench Google’s dominance. Search engines are fundamentally reliant on websites allowing themselves to be crawled so that the engines can understand their content and direct users to those sites. Nadella called search engines “the organizing layer of the internet” in that sense.  But as large language model-powered systems continue to grow, publishers and platforms are growing wary of how their data is ingested and used to train AI systems. Those publishers, Nadella said, may start to sign exclusive deals that allow Google — and only Google — to use their data. That would essentially crush every other search engine on the market.  “What is publicly available today, will it be publicly available tomorrow?” he asked; “That’s the issue.” He said he’s already hearing from publishers with a deal in place with Google, asking Bing to match it. Because of the legal fuzziness around AI, negotiations over platform uses of publisher content are a thing. But as Nadella notes, it risks creating a world in which the strongest players only get stronger, raising a huge barrier to entry. Still, it doesn’t take an MBA to understand that it’s better to have multiple tech giants angling for your content than to have just one. Google is happy to hand out money where it thinks it serves their interests, but it’s unlikely to rethink its operating fundamentals without an outside force — like the government and/or Apple — intervening.  This potential universe — where Apple and Google split the search market, much as they already do the smartphone OS market — is hardly the stuff of Bernie Sanders fantasies. (“So you’re telling me the big new competitor for a $2 trillion company is…a $3 trillion company?”) There’s no reason to be pollyannaish about Apple as a partner to publishers; it’s just as profit-hungry as Google and it lacks Google’s commitment to/reliance on the open web — always happy to build its own walled gardens. The ideal solution, of course, would be lots of competition, from the biggest giants to the tiniest startups — which is something Judge Mehta could be in a position to catalyze. My point isn’t that Apple would be a better tech overlord. It’s that competition is a good thing, even if it’s coming from two of the richest corporations in the history of humanity. Ideas move from unthinkable to, well, thinkable. Search is a critical — for many, the critical — supplier of audience to news publishers, and the rules for how it works are frozen because of one player’s market dominance. The groundwork can be laid now for those thousand flowers to bloom — but I suspect it’ll take another giant pushing Google off its pedestal first.

        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>The winning numbers were 9, 35, 54, 63, 64 and the Powerball 1. The last time someone won the top prize was July 19.

        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">The Powerball jackpot climbed to an estimated $1.4 billion after no players matched all six numbers and hit it rich Wednesday night. The winning numbers announced were: 9, 35, 54, 63, 64 and the Powerball 1. Players will next have a shot at the Powerball jackpot Saturday night in hopes of ending an 11-week stretch without a big winner. No matter how large the prize grows the odds stay the same — and they’re terrible. It’s those odds of 1 in 292.2 million that make the jackpot so hard to win and that result in such giant prizes for the lucky player or players who manage to pick the game’s six winning numbers. The latest Powerball jackpot is the world’s seventh-largest lottery prize. The last time someone won the top prize was July 19. In most states, Powerball tickets cost $2 and buyers can chose their own numbers and single Powerball or leave that task to a computer. Powerball drawings are held three times a week at 10:59 p.m. EDT on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturday, with the numbers selected at the Florida Lottery in Tallahassee. Once the numbers are chosen, it usually takes a couple hours to determine if there is a jackpot winner. If there isn’t a winner, state lottery officials release a jackpot estimate for the next drawing. If there is a winner, the jackpot reverts to $20 million and begins the long process of growing until there is another winner. Gale Groseclose, who was buying Powerball tickets in Pineville, North Carolina, said a $1 million prize would be plenty for her but that the Wednesday’s $1.2 billion jackpot certainly caught her attention. “I don’t usually do this on a regular basis, but like I said, when it gets to be, what is it? I don’t even know what, over 1 billion dollars,” Groseclose said. “It’s exciting.” The jackpot is based on revenue from ticket sales, so the more people who play the game, the faster the top prize grows. However, even though the current jackpot is advertised as $1.4 billion, the lottery has less than half that amount available for the top prize. That’s why the cash prize — which most winners take — would be $643.7 million. Players also can choose an annuity, in which that $643.7 million would be paid to a company that would guarantee a return over 30 years of $1.4 billion. If a winner dies before collecting all their money, the remainder would go to the winner’s estate. State lotteries will immediately deduct 24% of jackpot winnings for federal taxes, and additional federal taxes may be required when filing federal tax returns. State taxes will vary as some states don’t tax lottery winnings at all and others tax the money at different rates. Players who buy winning grand prize tickets in a state different from where they live will pay taxes based on where they bought the ticket. The game’s odds remain 1 in 292.2 million regardless of how big the jackpot is and the number of people buying tickets. Those odds mean there are 292.2 million possible number combinations. To put the immensity of that into context, note that for Monday’s drawing players across the country chose just over 20% of those possible combinations. That means nearly 80% of the possible combinations were not selected, so the odds were pretty good that there wouldn’t be a winner. Typically, the larger the jackpot grows, the more people play and the more combinations are covered. People also usually buy more tickets on Saturdays, which increases the chance of a winner for those drawings. Eric Warner, who also was buying tickets in Pineville, said he would immediately buy a Porsche if he won the big jackpot and then invest most of the money for himself and his community. Warner said he never really expects to win but enjoys buying a ticket now and then. “It’s something that I run into and maybe I’m feeling lucky,” he said. “Then I’ll go ahead and pick up a ticket and just kind of hope for the best.” Rules vary from state to state with some requiring that jackpot winners be named and others allowing anonymity. Some states have more detailed rules, such as in Florida, where winners can remain anonymous for 90 days before the state lottery releases their name. Powerball is played in 45 states as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The other nearly national lottery game, Mega Millions, is also played in those 45 states as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The five states that don’t participate in the games are Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        <p  class="element-article">The fraud trial that could block former President Donald Trump from doing business in New York drilled down Wednesday into the question of who — his company or hired accountants — bore responsibility for financial statements that the state calls fraudulent. With accountants on the witness stand and Trump at the defense table for a third day, his attorneys tried to pin blame on accounting firms for any problems with the statements. But lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James sought to show that the accountants relied entirely on information supplied by Trump and his company. Outside the courtroom, meanwhile, Trump’s lawyers appealed a key pretrial ruling: that he engaged in fraud by puffing up the values of prized assets. The trial concerns six claims that remain in the lawsuit after that ruling. Trump denies any wrongdoing. The trial comes as he leads the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, and the stakes are high for him and the real estate empire that launched him into public life. The pretrial ruling that’s now under appeal could cost him control of Trump Tower and some other properties. At the trial, James is seeking a $250 million penalty and a prohibition on Trump doing business in New York. At the heart of the case are the “statements of financial condition,” yearly snapshots of Trump’s wealth that were given to banks, insurers and others. James says the statements were wildly inflated. His Trump Tower penthouse was claimed as nearly three times its actual size, for example, and his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was hugely overvalued at as much as $739 million, she says. Trump maintains that the statements actually underestimated the worth of luxury properties. He also emphasizes that the documents came with disclaimers that he characterizes as saying the numbers shouldn’t be trusted and lenders should do their own homework. But accountant Donald Bender, who prepared the financial statements for years, testified Tuesday that the Trump Organization didn’t always supply all the information needed to accurately produce the documents. Another accountant, Camron Harris, testified Wednesday that his work on the 2021 statement involved checking information provided by Trump’s company for “obvious errors” and formatting it for presentation. “We do not verify the accuracy of any of the information provided,” Harris said. His firm’s work agreement with Trump’s company specified that the accountants would “not express an opinion or any conclusion nor provide any assurance on the financial statements.” Trump lawyer Jesus M. Suarez, in cross-examining Bender on Tuesday and Wednesday, sought to depict the accountant as sloppy. Suarez showed video Wednesday of pretrial testimony in which Bender said he didn’t recall whether he consulted with any specialists when preparing Trump’s financial statements. Yet, Suarez noted, Bender’s firm told clients it might need specialists’ help to evaluate works of art, jewelry, and some types of securities in closely held businesses and real estate. When Bender acknowledged on Tuesday that he missed a shift in information about the size of the Trump Tower penthouse, Suarez told the accountant that Trump’s company and employees were “going through hell” because “you missed it.” Bender retorted that it was the Trump Organization’s mistake, “and we didn’t catch it.” As the cross-examination wore on Wednesday with painstaking queries about specific aspects of individual financial statements, Judge Arthur Engoron pounded his fist and said the defense was ignoring his instructions to streamline the questioning. “This is ridiculous,” said the judge, who’s hearing the case without a jury because state law doesn’t allow for one in this type of lawsuit. Trump’s lawyers complained that the judge was compromising their ability to defend the former president. “I’ve never had to negotiate how to ask questions as a lawyer,” defense attorney Christopher Kise said. Trump, with familiar rhetoric outside court on Wednesday, called James “incompetent,” portrayed her as part of a broader Democratic effort to weaken his 2024 prospects, and termed the case “fake” and the trial “a disgrace.” “Why attend? Because I want to point it out to the press, how corrupt it is,” he said as he left court during its lunch break. He headed to Florida, next expected to return to the courtroom when he’s called to testify, likely several weeks from now. James later described his comments as offensive, baseless and “devoid of any facts and/or any evidence.” “The Donald Trump is show is over. This was nothing more than a political stunt. A fundraising stop. Now, we can continue to go forward with our trial, and we are confident that justice will be served,” James told reporters outside court. Trump has frequently vented in the courthouse hallway and on social media about the trial, James and Engoron, also a Democrat. After Trump assailed Engoron’s principal law clerk on social media Tuesday, the judge imposed a limited gag order, commanding all participants in the trial not to hurl personal attacks at members of his staff. The judge told Trump to delete the “disparaging, untrue and personally identifying post,” and the former president took it down. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Newly unsealed court testimonies reveal Apple held talks with both Microsoft and DuckDuckGo to use their search engines across Apple devices. The potential of a Microsoft deal also served as a useful bargaining chip for Apple when negotiating its lucrative search deal with Google. Apple met with Microsoft in 2018, and later in 2020 to discuss a potential Bing acquisition or joint venture.

        <p  class="element-article">By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards. While Google’s search engine has for years been the default on Apple’s devices, newly unsealed court testimonies reveal that Apple held talks with both Microsoft and DuckDuckGo to use their search engines across Apple devices, and in Microsoft’s case even potentially buying Bing, The Washington Post and Bloomberg report. The potential of a Microsoft deal also served as a useful bargaining chip for Apple when negotiating its lucrative search deal with Google. The details came to light as part of the Department of Justice’s landmark antitrust case against Google which accuses the search giant of abusing its dominance of the search market. A key element of this trial is an agreement that sees Google pay Apple billions of dollars a year in a revenue sharing deal to make Google search the default across Apple’s devices. Apple has defended the deal, saying that there wasn’t a viable alternative search engine available. News that Apple considered purchasing Bing emerged in a report from Bloomberg last week, but the newly unsealed testimony of Apple senior vice president John Giannandrea sheds more light on the discussions. Apple met with Microsoft in 2018, and later in 2020 to discuss a potential Bing acquisition or joint venture, Bloomberg reports. The company even studied the quality of Bing’s search results compared with Google, but found Bing generally performed worse except for desktop searches in English. Apple has used Bing as the default search service for some of its products in the past (between 2013 and 2017, Microsoft’s search engine provided answers for searches made through Siri and Spotlight), but it ultimately decided to stick with Google in a deal estimated to be worth around $19 billion to Apple annually. Although Apple appeared to be considering a deal with Microsoft, one internal Apple email surfaced as part of the trial suggests the company was — at least partially — using Bing as a negotiating tactic to extract more money from Google.  “We build them [Microsoft] up, create incremental negotiating leverage to keep the take rate from Google, and further our optionality to replace Google down the line,” Apple vice president Adrian Perica wrote, The Washington Post reports. For its part, Microsoft was aware that it was being used for leverage. “It is no secret that Apple is making more money on Bing existing than Bing does,’’ Microsoft’s chief of advertising and web services Mikhail Parakhin testified as part of the court hearing. Apple also had around 20 meetings and phone calls with DuckDuckGo to discuss making the search engine the default for Safari’s private browsing mode, according to newly unsealed testimony from DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg. DuckDuckGo markets itself as a more privacy focussed alternative to the major search engines. Although Weinberg says he “thought [Apple] would launch it,” Apple’s Giannandrea says he wasn’t aware that the company had considered a switch, and even called DuckDuckGo’s privacy claims into question, Bloomberg notes. According to Giannandrea, DuckDuckGo’s reliance on Bing for search information risks sharing user information with Microsoft. “I would probably insist on doing a lot more due diligence with DuckDuckGo” if Apple were to seriously consider switching, Giannandrea said.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">As the leader of a company that tracks tech employment trends, I’ve had a front-row seat to the industry’s highs and lows over the past few decades. It’s literally my job to keep up with tech employment trends and I can tell you one thing: It’s an interesting time for both workers and decision-makers in the tech sector. However, beware of news headlines that show only one side of the story. The U.S. tech economy is going through some unusual changes–and it’s not always easy to wrap your head around them. Maybe you’ve seen the recent Wall Street Journal article making the rounds, exploring the $900,000 AI tech job. It’s a great read–but salary trends are not quite so straightforward. When it comes to tech salaries, the devil is in the details. Historically, there have been three areas of tech significantly undersupplied: Artificial Intelligence (generative AI and machine learning), cybersecurity, and cloud engineering. Due to limited supply, these specialties already experience higher wage increases than other tech roles–and are natural focal points for today’s tech media coverage. There’s no question these hot spots exist in tech spaces, but we should view any associated spikes in salary among these roles as outliers. My company’s annual salary survey found that the average compensation for tech roles rose by roughly 7% in 2022. It’s a big jump for the industry and evidence of the surge in demand following the pandemic. But apart from certain hot spots, we expect a normalization back to typical wage pressure, meaning salaries across the tech sector are not as favorable as they may appear. Salaries are extremely sensitive to supply and demand, and demand for tech roles has dropped significantly compared to last year. In CompTIA’s August report, while three of the company’s four employment stats were trending positively, job postings (arguably the most important statistic) were down. Job postings for the month of August totaled 204,400–the lowest point in the past three years and less than a third of total job postings for the same period in 2022. Despite turnarounds in the overall unemployment rate across the tech sector, technologists have less bargaining power. Salary is up in selective circumstances, but not universally. The U.S. tech economy operates differently than other sectors. In the first half of 2023, the U.S. was down almost 100,000 tech jobs. There have only been three times in the last two decades when this was the case: the dot-com implosion in 2001, the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Tech growth is typically a reliable ramp-up and to the right, so it’s shocking that we recently lost so many tech jobs. These trends indicate a tech recession. America’s GDP is growing, but parts of our economy have contracted significantly, including tech. Regardless of the overall economy, employers have realized that tech positions are sitting well above the average wage rate. So, while companies may still be in a position to hire after a rough start to 2023 (and a tough few years), there’s still wariness about hiring tech employees. The U.S. economy may be showing signs of better days to come–but the U.S. tech economy has more catching up to do. A focus on salaries alone is somewhat shortsighted when we evaluate tech hiring trends. We must look at other reasons why employees are staying in their current roles. Recent research from McKinsey found that compensation and financial factors ranked fourth behind considerations such as career development, flexibility, and meaningful connections. Work-life balance and culture are now influencing workers’ decision-making and loyalty. Tech workers want remote and hybrid work options–and they expect their current level of flexibility to continue. The tech workspace of the past is gone. We know that the old approach didn’t improve productivity and commuting makes no sense today. The leaders and teams I talk to across tech recognize there’s been a real shift in sentiment around hybrid and remote work, one we’re unlikely to walk back. While employers understand that tech workers expect flexibility, leadership teams are trying to determine if they have the negotiating power to demand in-office work without creating too many waves as we head into 2024. Only time will tell if they do. Another recent study from McKinsey explored the impact of AI in different work modalities for software developers working on code. The top improvement? Documentation. When developers write a line of code, they’re supposed to document what that line of code does. While an important step, documentation is tedious and not very exciting. As a result, workers get around to it less often or not as quickly as they should (if at all). AI can support this type of documentation work, but that’s currently where AI applications end in many technical roles. AI isn’t likely to change the role of being a technologist in the next five to 10 years beyond simple support tasks–and it won’t take away jobs or lower average tech salaries. Coding is all about solving problems, which AI isn’t ready for yet. There’s an assumption in certain circles that companies will start to pay technologists less because they’ll do less work as AI intervenes to support them. But that’s not true. Rather, technologist salaries will likely climb as employers ask the people in these roles to take on more diverse responsibilities. The past few decades in tech have proven that as technologists gain access to new tools, they use those tools daily, become proficient in them, and then establish an assisted level of output as the new norm. We expect the same to be the case with AI. In an industry that evolves as quickly as tech, it’s important to do your homework. Research, talk to your peers, and don’t take trending headlines at face value. What you see on the surface may only present part of the story. Art Zeile is the CEO of Dice.

        <p  class="element-article">After a summer of record-smashing heat, warming somehow got even worse in September as Earth set a new mark for how far above normal temperatures were, the European climate agency reported Thursday. Last month’s average temperature was 0.93 degrees Celsius (1.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 1991-2020 average for September. That’s the warmest margin above average for a month in 83 years of records kept by the European Space Agency’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. “It’s just mind-blowing really,” said Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo. “Never seen anything like that in any month in our records.” While July and August had hotter raw temperatures because they are warmer months on the calendar, September had what scientists call the biggest anomaly, or departure from normal. Temperature anomalies are crucial pieces of data in a warming world. “This is not a fancy weather statistic,” Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto said in an email. “It’s a death sentence for people and ecosystems. It destroys assets, infrastructure, harvest.” Copernicus calculated that the average temperature for September was 16.38 degrees Celsius (61.48 degrees Fahrenheit), which broke the old record set in September 2020 by a whopping half-degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit). That’s a huge margin in climate records. The hot temperatures stretched across the globe but they were chiefly driven by persistent and unusual warmth in the world’s oceans, which didn’t cool off as much in September as normal and have been record hot since spring, said Buontempo. Earth is on track for its hottest year on record, about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Samantha Burgess, Copernicus’ deputy director. This past September was 1.75 degrees Celsius (3.15 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-1800s, Copernicus reported. The world agreed in 2015 to try to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warming since pre-industrial times. The global threshold goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius is for long-term temperature averages, not a single month or year. But scientists still expressed grave concern at the records being set. “What we’re seeing right now is the backdrop of rapid global warming at a pace that the Earth has not seen in eons coupled with El Nino, natural climate cycle” that’s a temporary warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide, said U.S. climate scientist Jessica Moerman, who is also president of the Evangelical Environmental Network. “This double whammy together is where things get dangerous.” Though El Nino is playing a part, climate change has a bigger footprint in this warmth, Buontempo said. “There really is no end in sight given new oil and gas reserves are still being opened for exploitation,” Otto said. “If you have more record hot events, there is no respite for humans and nature, no time to recover.” Buontempo said El Nino is likely to get warmer and cause even higher temperatures next year. “This month was, in my professional opinion as a climate scientist – absolutely gobsmackingly bananas,” climate scientist Zeke Hausfather said on X, formerly known as Twitter. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Will Elliott, a life coach and co-founder of The Action Effect, runs an Instagram account for parents looking to raise self-assured kids. He provides parenting strategies to “raise confident, courageous and character-centered tweens/teens,” according to his account.

        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">Raising resilient children is daunting. How can you set kids up for success in this pressure-cooker environment of FOMO and competition? One parenting expert says to start by putting less emphasis on wins, practice patience, give grace, and redefine success. Will Elliott, a life coach and co-founder of The Action Effect, a coaching company geared toward parents and teen relationships, runs an Instagram account for parents looking to raise self-assured kids. He provides parenting strategies to “raise confident, courageous and character-centered tweens/teens,” according to his account. As young adults feel the most lonely compared to older generations, it’s readily apparent that many struggle with their mental health. These forces can diminish young adults’ confidence. However, finding ways to encourage self-trust can rival the uncomfortable nature of uncertainty in their lives, Elliott highlights in his online posts.  Here are Elliott’s ten ways to boost your child’s confidence:  Instead of jumping in with solutions when you sense something is wrong, practice pausing and listening.  “Let go of your desire to ‘fix’ their problems and recognize it’s in those problems they get meaningful experience that creates lasting impact,” Elliott, who has coached teens and parents since 2019, wrote in a recent Instagram post. Listening helps create trust and allows for vulnerability in a relationship.  Acknowledge the small wins, which will slowly amount to big ones. Be encouraging about everything from homework to doing the dishes—daily habits that instill helpful skills and values, says Elliot.  “The way we build self esteem is by doing esteemable acts,” Aja Chavez, therapist and executive director of adolescent services at Mission Prep, a residential adolescent mental health treatment program in California, previously told Fortune. “Chores create a sense of community and connection and start to build in personal responsibility.” Stop “moving the destination of success,” Elliott reminds parents. It can make kids feel like they will never hit the bullseye or do things right in the eyes of their parents.  About to lay down the law or have the urge to raise your voice to get your point across? Instead, ask your child why they decided to take a specific action and respond from there.  Shift your mindset to, “I’m here to understand your heart and your struggles,” Elliott writes.  Slamming the door, albeit disrespectful, may also stem from something completely unrelated and signal frustration or embarrassment. Without judgment, try to understand why certain emotions and actions take place. Kids are more likely to listen and share when they feel heard.  This one is just as it sounds. When you want to react out of emotion, stop, breathe, and take a beat.  Ultimately, you need to let children figure things out for themselves and remember that setbacks are part of growth.  “The more pressure you put on yourself to be a perfect parent and have perfect kids, the more pressure you inevitably put on them,” Elliott writes. “Surrender. Let it go…” Elliott encourages parents to place higher importance on their children’s effort and character instead of their results.  “When kids attach their confidence and success to things they can control, like effort and character, they’re unstoppable,” Elliott said in another post.  Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman has echoed this same ethos, saying there is a scientifically unhelpful way to praise your children: hint, don’t tell them they are gifted and talented. When praise relates to someone’s results, the brain conflates the sense of self and identity with that success. Therefore, someone’s level of confidence directly depends on their subsequent accomplishments.  “If you’re a parent or teacher, you have to be very careful about giving feedback to a child that is attached to their identity around an endeavor, especially if they’re performing well at that endeavor,” Andrew Huberman, a professor of at Stanford School of Medicine and host of the Huberman Lab, said in his podcast.  Praising children for their results doesn’t encourage them to have a growth mindset, defined as feeling encouraged to try new ways of solving challenging problems. In fact, it may cause them to work less diligently. Instead, praise their kids with action verbs based on their effort. It’s important to be the example you hope your kids will emulate. If you don’t want social media running your kid’s life, don’t walk around the house posting pictures of the dog or your pasta dinner.  The definition of success is different for everyone. Check in with yourself and understand what success means for you. It’s easy to get caught up in who won what or got which grade, but it’s the effort and the values your kids demonstrate that matter.  When you praise someone’s character, grit, and drive, they will continue to put in the effort even if the outcome is uncertain. That more nuanced definition of success can help kids manage difficulty and feel proud of themselves. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">The Biden administration announced it waived 26 federal laws in South Texas to allow border wall construction on Wednesday, marking the administration’s first use of a sweeping executive power employed often during the Trump presidency. The Department of Homeland Security posted the announcement on the U.S. Federal Registry with few details outlining the construction in Starr County, Texas, which is part of a busy Border Patrol sector seeing “high illegal entry.” According to government data, about 245,000 illegal entries have been recorded so far this fiscal year in the Rio Grande Valley Sector which contains 21 counties. “There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States in the project areas,” Alejandro Mayorkas, the DHS secretary, stated in the notice. The Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Endangered Species Act were some of the federal laws waived by DHS to make way for construction that will use funds from a congressional appropriation in 2019 for border wall construction. The waivers avoid time-consuming reviews and lawsuits challenging violation of environmental laws. Starr County’s hilly ranchlands, sitting between Zapata and McAllen, Texas, is home to about 65,000 residents sparsely populating about 1,200 square miles (3,108 square kilometers) that form part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Although no maps were provided in the announcement, CBP announced the project in June and began gathering public comments in August when it shared a map of the additional construction that can add up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) to the existing border barrier system in the area. Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said it will start south of the Falcon Dam and go past Salineño, Texas. “The other concern that we have is that area is highly erosive. There’s a lot of arroyos,” Eloy Vera, the county judge said, pointing out the creeks cutting through the ranchland and leading into the river. Concern is shared with environmental advocates who say structures will run through public lands, habitats of endangered plants and species like the Ocelot, a spotted wild cat. “A plan to build a wall through will bulldoze an impermeable barrier straight through the heart of that habitat. It will stop wildlife migrations dead in their tracks. It will destroy a huge amount of wildlife refuge land. And it’s a horrific step backwards for the borderlands,” Laiken Jordahl, a southwest conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Wednesday afternoon. During the Trump administration, about 450 miles (724 kilometers) of barriers were built along the southwest border between 2017 and January 2021. Texas Governor Greg Abbott renewed those efforts after the Biden administration halted them at the start of his presidency. The DHS decision on Wednesday contrasts the Biden administration’s posturing when a proclamation to end the construction on Jan. 20, 2021, stated, “building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution.” In a statement Wednesday, CBP said the project is consistent with that 2021 proclamation. “Congress appropriated fiscal year 2019 funds for the construction of border barrier in the Rio Grande Valley, and DHS is required to use those funds for their appropriated purpose,” the statement said. “CBP remains committed to protecting the nation’s cultural and natural resources and will implement sound environmental practices as part of the project covered by this waiver.” The announcement prompted political debate by the Democratic administration facing an increase of migrants entering through the southern border in recent months, including thousands who entered the U.S. through Eagle Pass at the end of September. “A border wall is a 14th century solution to a 21st century problem. It will not bolster border security in Starr County,” U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar said in a statement. “I continue to stand against the wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective border wall.” Political proponents of the border wall said the waivers should be used as a launching pad for a shift in policy. “After years of denying that a border wall and other physical barriers are effective, the DHS announcement represents a sea change in the administration’s thinking: A secure wall is an effective tool for maintaining control of our borders,” Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said in a statement. “Having made that concession, the administration needs to immediately begin construction of wall across the border to prevent the illegal traffic from simply moving to other areas of the border.” © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        <p  class="element-article">Retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre will answer questions under oath about the misspending of federal welfare money in Mississippi, where public money intended to help some of the nation’s poorest people was used to fund pet projects he and other well-connected people supported. A notice of deposition filed Monday in Hinds County Circuit Court by attorneys for Mississippi’s Department of Human Services shows Favre will give sworn testimony on Oct. 26 at a hotel in Hattiesburg. The Pro Football Hall of Famer is among more than three dozen defendants in a lawsuit the current Human Services director filed to recover some of the welfare money. Favre has denied wrongdoing, sued the state auditor who investigated the misspending for defamation and said he paid back misspent welfare funds. Mississippi has ranked among the poorest states in the U.S. for decades, but only a fraction of its federal welfare money has been going toward direct aid to families. Instead, the Mississippi Department of Human Services allowed well-connected people to fritter away $77 million in federal welfare funds from 2016 to 2019, according to the state auditor and state and federal prosecutors. Instead of going to needy families, about $5 million helped fund a volleyball arena that Favre supported at his alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, said Mississippi Auditor Shad White, whose office investigated the scandal. Favre’s daughter played volleyball at the school. Another $1.7 million went to the development of a concussion treatment drug, a project Favre supported. No criminal charges have been brought against Favre, although a former department director and other people have pleaded guilty to their part in the misspending. Favre has asked the Hinds County Circuit Court and the Mississippi Supreme Court to remove him as a defendant in the civil lawsuit, but both requests were denied. The deposition will be conducted by oral examination before a court reporter and may be video-recorded. A confidentiality order approved by the court would keep all of the testimony private for at least 30 days after its completion date, court records show. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        <p  class="element-article">Workers in California will soon receive a minimum of five days of paid sick leave annually, instead of three, under a new law Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Wednesday. The law, which takes effect in January, also increases the amount of sick leave workers can carry over into the following year. Newsom said it demonstrates that prioritizing the health and well-being of workers “is of the utmost importance for California’s future.” “Too many folks are still having to choose between skipping a day’s pay and taking care of themselves or their family members when they get sick,” Newsom said in a statement announcing his action. It was one of more than a dozen bills the Democratic governor signed Wednesday. He has until mid-October to act on all the legislation sent to him this year. He can sign, veto or let bills become law without his signature. Beyond preventing workers from choosing between taking a day off or getting paid, proponents of the sick day legislation argue it will help curb the spread of diseases and make sure employees can be productive at work. But the California Chamber of Commerce, which represents businesses across the state, said it will be burdensome for small businesses. “Far too many small employers simply cannot absorb this new cost, especially when viewed in context of all of California’s other leaves and paid benefits, and they will have to reduce jobs, cut wages, or raise consumer prices to deal with this mandate,” Jennifer Barrera, the group’s president, said in a statement. The law was among several major labor initiatives in the Legislature this year, including proposals to raise the wages of health care workers and allow legislative staffers to unionize. Newsom already signed a law to raise the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour. But he vetoed a bill Saturday that would have given unemployment benefits to striking workers, saying the fund the state would use is approaching nearly $20 billion in debt. The United Food and Commercial Workers Western States Council, which supported the sick day legislation, said the law will help prevent the spread of deadly diseases. “Five paid sick days is a step in the right direction and workers will be less likely forced to risk their livelihoods to do the right thing and stay home when they’re sick because of this bill,” Andrea Zinder, president of the group’s Local 324 chapter, said in a statement. Newsom also signed a law Wednesday to ban local government from manually counting ballots in most cases, a direct response to a rural Northern California county’s plan to stop using machines to count votes. Shasta County’s board of supervisors, controlled by a conservative majority, voted earlier this year to end its contract with Dominion Voting Systems, a company that has been subject to unfounded allegations of fraud pushed by former Republican President Donald Trump and his allies. County leaders said there was a loss of public confidence in the company’s machines. At the time, local leaders did not have a plan for how the county would conduct future elections for its 111,000 registered voters. The county had been preparing to count ballots by hand for its next election on Nov. 7, 2023, to fill seats on the school board and fire district board and decide the fate of two ballot measures. The new law, which takes effect immediately, halts Shasta County officials’ plans. The only exceptions under the law are for regularly scheduled elections with fewer than 1,000 eligible registered voters and special elections where there are fewer than 5,000 eligible voters. Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, a Democrat from Santa Cruz who authored the law and is a former local elections official, said the law creates necessary guardrails around elections. The law also requires local government use state-certified voting machines. The legislation “ensures that no California voter will be disenfranchised by the actions and decisions of ill-informed political actors,” she said in a statement. The legislation has divided the rural county. Shasta County Clerk Cathy Darling Allen, a Democrat, called the law a “commonsense protection for all California voters.” Despite the county getting rid of its Dominion voting machines, local leaders gave her permission to purchase equipment needed to comply with federal laws for voters with disabilities. The system that was purchased, made by Hart InterCivic, includes scanners capable of tabulating votes electronically. The equipment will be used to tabulate votes in upcoming elections, Darling Allen said. Shasta County Board of Supervisors chair Patrick Henry Jones told The Associated Press in September the county would sue to block the law, adding that state officials “cannot guarantee that these machines haven’t been manipulated.” Jones didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Newsom signing the bill into law. While hand counts of ballots occur in parts of the United States, this typically happens in small jurisdictions with small numbers of registered voters. Hand counts, however, are commonly used as part of post-election tests to check that machines are counting ballots correctly, but only a small portion of the ballots are counted manually. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        <h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23904375/uk-cma-microsoft-amazon-cloud-investigation">Microsoft and Amazon face UK regulator investigation over cloud services</a></h2>
        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a new investigation into cloud service providers. The CMA is particularly concerned about the practices of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft because of their market position. Ofcom found issues with charges that cloud customers have to pay to move their data out of the cloud, discounts to only use one cloud provider, and technical barriers to switching between cloud providers. Microsoft has been reportedly trying to fend off a full EU antitrust investigation, with Reuters reporting in March that it had offered to change its cloud computing practices. The EU has opened a formal antitrust investigation into Microsoft”s Teams bundling with Office, but we’re still waiting to hear if the regulator will also take up the Azure concerns.</p>
        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. The clouds are gathering over Microsoft’s Azure operations in the EU and now the UK, with the launch of a new investigation into major cloud service providers that also includes Amazon. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is just about to wrap up its concerns over cloud gaming with Microsoft’s proposed Activision Blizzard acquisition, but it will soon turn its attention to Microsoft’s Azure cloud offerings and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It’s part of a fresh investigation into public cloud providers in the UK, after telecoms regulator Ofcom “identified a number of features in the supply of cloud services that make it more difficult for customers to switch and use multiple cloud suppliers.” Ofcom found issues with charges that cloud customers have to pay to move their data out of the cloud, discounts to only use one cloud provider, and technical barriers to switching between cloud providers. The CMA specifically calls out Microsoft, too. “Ofcom’s report also outlines concerns it has heard about the software licensing practices of some cloud providers, in particular Microsoft,” says the CMA in its press release today. Telecoms regulator Ofcom found issues with cloud services in the UK “The CMA’s independent inquiry group will now carry out an investigation to determine whether competition in this market is working well and if not, what action should be taken to address any issues it finds,” says Sarah Cardell, CEO of the CMA. Although the CMA doesn’t specifically name Amazon, Ofcom’s market study identified that both Microsoft and Amazon control around 70-80 percent of the public cloud infrastructure in the UK and that it was “particularly concerned about the practices of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft because of their market position.” Ofcom and the CMA aren’t alone in their concerns over cloud market competition, either. The Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE) trade group, which includes Amazon, filed an antitrust complaint with the EU last year. The group argues “Microsoft uses its dominance in productivity software to direct European customers to its own Azure cloud infrastructure to the detriment of European cloud infrastructure providers and users of IT services.” Microsoft offered some licensing concessions more than a year ago, but they haven’t been enough to address the ongoing complaints. Google even publicly called out Microsoft’s cloud software licensing “tax” earlier this year, arguing that businesses have to pay extra when they want to run software like Office on other cloud networks. “Microsoft publicly touts that if you run their software on Azure versus other vendors like AWS and GCP, it’s five times cheaper or it’s more expensive to run on us, basically because of the tax customers have to pay to Microsoft,” said Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud, in an interview with The Register earlier this year. “The price of the products are the same in terms of infrastructure and everything else, so the licensing cost is more expensive because of using providers other than Azure.” “We are committed to ensuring the UK cloud industry remains innovative, highly competitive and an accelerator for growth across the economy,” Hugh Milward, Microsoft UK’s vice president of external affairs said in a statement. “We will engage constructively with the CMA as they conduct their Cloud Services Market Investigation.” Microsoft has been reportedly trying to fend off a full EU antitrust investigation, with Reuters reporting in March that it had offered to change its cloud computing practices. The EU has opened a formal antitrust investigation into Microsoft’s Teams bundling with Office, but we’re still waiting to hear if the regulator will also take up the Azure concerns.  The CMA’s market investigation could take 18 months to complete, with a statutory deadline set for April 4th, 2025. The UK regulator will outline theories of harm and any potential remedies that might address the situation. The UK regulator also has the power to “impose structural remedies which can require companies to sell parts of their business to improve competition.” “We disagree with Ofcom’s findings and believe they are based on a fundamental misconception of how the IT sector functions, and the services and discounts on offer,” says Amazon spokesperson Harry Straight in a statement to The Verge. “Only a small percentage of IT spend is in the cloud, and customers can meet their IT needs from any combination of on-premises hardware and software, managed or co-location services, and cloud services. Amazon is planning to “work constructively with the CMA,” but warns “any unwarranted intervention could lead to unintended harm to IT customers and competition.” Update October 5th, 12:28PM ET: Article updated with a statement from Microsoft.

        <p  class="element-article">Middle aged women who have ongoing insomnia or get little sleep each night may be at greater risk for heart disease, according to new research presented at The Menopause Society Conference in Philadelphia in Sept.  Heart disease is the leading killer of women in the United States, and once women hit menopause, their risk of developing it increases. Researchers wanted to examine whether issues with sleep—a chief complaint among menopausal women—could be behind the uptick in cardiovascular risk. A research team at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health assessed data from SWAN, a long-term study of 3,300 mid-life women from five different racial and ethnic groups across the U.S. The team asked participants whether they’d had trouble falling asleep, woke up during the night, or woke up earlier than planned in the prior month—classic insomnia symptoms. Women were considered to have insomnia if they reported any of these issues three or four times per week. Participants were also classified into short sleep duration (5 hours), moderate duration (6 hours) or long duration (7 hours) sleepers. Researchers further assessed cardiovascular disease events, including heart attack, stroke, bypass surgery, heart failure and heart disease-related death.  “Women with persistent insomnia had a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular disease compared with women who had few insomnia symptoms over midlife,” said Rebecca Thurston, professor of psychiatry and director of the Women’s Biobehavioral Health Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health. There was an almost doubling of risk between the two groups, Thurston said, and even when age, race, ethnicity, education, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors were accounted for, the increased risk was still significant, at 1.7 times. When just sleep duration data was analyzed, women with persistent short sleep had marginally increased cardiovascular disease risk vs. moderate, or longer sleepers, however, overall data showed that women with both persistent insomnia and short sleep were at highest risk of heart disease. “Midlife women with persistent insomnia symptoms either alone or in combination with short sleep duration had a 70% to 75% increased risk of cardiovascular disease events over the two decades of follow up, after adjusting for demographic factors and cardiovascular disease risk factors,” Thurston said. “These findings underscore the importance of considering sleep when we’re assessing women’s cardiovascular disease risks.” Midlife is a time directly before the onset of clinical cardiovascular disease events in women. “It’s a critical time for cardiovascular disease prevention,” Thurston said. She encouraged mid-life women and their physicians to discuss sleep patterns and start making any necessary behavioral changes that could help reduce heart disease risk.

        <p  class="element-article">Meaningful progress has been made in negotiations between the striking United Auto Workers union and Detroit’s three auto companies, according to a person with direct knowledge of the talks. The person said Wednesday that progress was reported at all three companies, with some offers being exchanged. Another said there was more movement in talks with Jeep maker Stellantis, with less at Ford and General Motors. Neither person wanted to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the bargaining. Union President Shawn Fain will update members Friday on bargaining toward bringing to an end the nearly 3-week-old strikes against the companies. It wasn’t clear exactly what Fain will announce as part of the union’s strategy of targeted strikes against the companies, with automakers perceived as making progress in the talks being spared additional job actions. But the report of progress raises the possibility that the union may decide not to expand its walkouts at one or more of the companies. The union has so far limited the strike to about 25,000 workers at five vehicle assembly plants and 38 parts warehouses. Fain has announced strike expansions on each of the past two Fridays. Ford said Tuesday that it increased its offer to the union on Monday night, but provisions made public by the company were close to previous offers. The company said its seventh offer raised the general wage increase to over 20% over four years without compounding. It also said the company raised its 401(k) retirement contributions and confirmed profit sharing was offered to temporary workers. Those workers also would see a pay raise from $16.67 per hour to $21. Ford, which had made early progress, was spared from the second round of strikes, and its parts warehouses remain open. Stellantis was exempted last week, when the union added assembly plants at Ford in Chicago and GM in Lansing, Michigan. So far the union has avoided strikes at large pickup truck and SUV factories, vehicles that are responsible for much of the automakers’ profits. The union has about 146,000 members at all three companies combined. The targeted strike strategy helps to preserve the UAW’s strike fund, which was $825 million before the strikes began on Sept. 15. GM and Ford have laid off just over 3,500 UAW workers at plants not covered by the strikes. Those workers will get union strike pay of $500 per week. The UAW contends the companies have made billions of dollars in profits during the past decade and raised CEO pay, so they can afford to boost workers’ wages. The union is seeking 36% general wage increases over four years as well as a return of cost-of-living increases, a 32-hour week with 40 hours of pay, the restoration of traditional defined-benefit pensions for new hires, among other benefits. It also wants to represent workers at 10 joint venture electric vehicle battery factories in the U.S. that have been proposed by the companies. The companies, however, fear that raising their labor costs could make their vehicles more expensive than those manufactured by Tesla or foreign automakers with U.S. factories where workers are paid less. GM on Wednesday announced that it has lined up a line of credit of up to $6 billion in light of the strike. The company said it is “being prudent in the face of uncertainty.” GM also said it estimates the strike cost the company about $200 million in lost production in the third quarter. The union has dropped unfair labor practice charges filed against GM and Stellantis that had accused the companies of failing to bargain in good faith ahead of the strikes. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Our algorithm tries to optimize time spent on X, so links don’t get as much attention, because there is less time spent if people click away.  Best thing is to post content in long form on this platform. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 3, 2023  The move doesn’t really come as a surprise, given Musk posted about the change in August. At that time he said that stripping headline text from link previews would “greatly improve the esthetics.” X is not the only platform thinking about news and headlines differently. Artifact, a platform built by Instagram co-founders, is trying to make the app a discovery platform by encouraging users to post links from all over the web. In June, it started taking the help of AI to rewrite headlines of articles users deem to be clickbait. In September, Musk said that X users are creating 100 million to 200 million posts every day. On Wednesday, the social media company’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, said at a conference that users are sending 500 million posts per day. An X executive confirmed to TechCrunch that Yaccarino’s number was the accurate one. Reuters reported Wednesday that X’s revenue has declined each month by at least 55% year-on-year after Musk took over the company. The company has faced challenges in retaining advertisers for the platform. In recent interviews, Yaccarino mentioned that advertisers are returning to the platform and have claimed that the company will be profitable next year.</p>

        <p>TikTok, owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, has suspended its shopping platform in Indonesia. The move is to comply with new government regulations. Indonesia is home to some 125 million TikTok users, making it the platform’s second largest market after the U.S. TikTok is also trying to generate e-commerce revenue in the United States, but it faces competition from players such as Shopee and Lazada, the latter of which is majority-owned by another Chinese tech firm, Alibaba.

        <p  class="element-article">Indonesia has dealt a critical blow to TikTok’s bold plan to turn millions of users into shoppers. On Wednesday, TikTok, which is owned by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, suspended its shopping platform in the Southeast Asian country to comply with new government regulations. TikTok Indonesia said in a statement on Tuesday that its “priority is to remain compliant with local laws and regulation” and as such will “no longer facilitate e-commerce transactions in TikTok Shop Indonesia,” starting 5 p.m. local time on Oct. 4.  Last week, Jakarta announced that it would require tech companies to separate their e-commerce offerings from their social media apps, thus banning users from buying and selling goods on platforms like TikTok and Facebook.  Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is home to some 125 million TikTok users, making it the platform’s second largest market after the U.S. ByteDance bet big on the country, choosing it as the first non-Chinese market for its social e-commerce service in April 2021. As late as June, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the company would invest billions of dollars in Indonesia and other countries to further expand its footprint in the region. Yet last month, Indonesian President Joko Widodo complained that social-media-based e-commerce threatened the country’s micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises. Officials have previously accused TikTok of allowing predatory pricing on its platform and said it harmed local businesses. To give an idea of the business landscape, Indonesia has more than 64 million micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises that contribute to over 60% of the country’s GDP.  E-commerce is big business for ByteDance. In China, consumer spending on Douyin—the Chinese version of TikTok—increased by 76% year on year in 2022 to hit $195 billion, The Information reported.  Yet ByteDance could struggle to replicate its Chinese success globally. In addition to Indonesia, TikTok Shop is available in other Southeast Asian countries like Singapore and Vietnam, but it faces competition from players such as Shopee and Lazada, the latter of which is majority-owned by another Chinese tech giant, Alibaba.  TikTok is also trying to generate e-commerce revenue in the U.S. TikTok Shop officially launched in the U.S. in mid-September. Yet low-quality offerings and the company’s policies on sharing consumer data are turning off some of TikTok’s prospective partners, Fortune reported during the week of the service’s launch.  The app is also in the crosshairs of U.S. lawmakers who see TikTok as a national security risk. The U.S. already bars the app from government devices, and some officials and legislators are considering an outright ban of the social media app.  © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        <p  class="element-article">By  Umar Shakir, a news writer fond of the electric vehicle lifestyle and things that plug in via USB-C. He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.  A young electric vehicle infrastructure company founded by former SpaceX employees called Electric Era has designed EV charging stations that convenience stores can buy and manage with minimal power upgrades. Now, with a new round of funding that includes Chevron Technology Ventures, the startup hopes it can convince prospective buyers to ease in on the electric vehicle future, especially as gas station traffic eventually dwindles down. People who drive gas cars exist in a more than-century-old ecosystem where they post up at a pump for up to 15 minutes to fuel up, use the bathroom, grab a soda and a pack of cigarettes, and maybe a lottery ticket or a crusty hot dog from the convenience store. However, those pumps and stores might not last as the world transitions over to electric vehicles, which are generally charged at home or sometimes at inconveniently located (and increasingly unreliable) EV charging stations.  Electric Era is offering an electric vehicle system for convenience stores that includes a “PowerNode” block that can handle even the most fragile grid power in the country. It includes its own management software and built-in battery pack, kind of like the ones homeowners can buy, but can charge EVs at accelerated DC speeds without stressing the grid. It also gives convenience store owners an opportunity to sell unused stored energy back to the grid as another revenue stream on top of new foot traffic courtesy of bored electric vehicle owners. The first PowerNode EV fast charging station deployments from Electric Era are set to go online “in the coming weeks” at a Plaid Pantry store and a Space Age Fuels in the Portland, Oregon metro area, according to a press release. Before the end of 2023, the startup is planning another at Seven Feathers Travel Plaza in southwest Oregon, and more than 10 stations across seven states.

Lawyers swap opening statements before first witnesses take the stand</a></h2>
        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, is on trial in New York. He is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that stole money from customers and investors. His lawyers say he acted in good faith, and that he didn't steal any money. But the prosecution says he stole money to fund a lavish lifestyle and a political campaign, among other things. The first witness called to the stand was Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London, who lives with his wife and two children in Paris, where he works as a hedge fund manager. The trial is expected to last about a week and a half before the jury is sequestered for its verdict.</p>
        <h2 class="element-title" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Article </h2>
        <p  class="element-article">Who is Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX? Is he a liar and a fraud? Or did he act in good faith, and like many a startup founder, fly too close to the sun? That answer ultimately lies with the jury, which was selected on Wednesday morning before lawyers for the government and then Bankman-Fried swapped two very different stories of the former crypto mogul’s sudden rise and almost instantaneous fall. Here’s what happened on the second day of the trial, which featured pointed allegations, a friend from MIT, and an audience replete with big names, including Bankman-Fried’s professorial parents and Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The prosecution’s account of the alleged crimes by Bankman-Fried, who spent most of his day in court staring into a laptop while seated between his two attorneys, featured a study in contrasts. “One year ago, it looked like the defendant was on the top of the world,” began Thane Rehn, a prosecutor for the government, in his opening statement. The former CEO of FTX oversaw a supposedly thriving crypto exchange, jetted between international locales, and hobnobbed with celebrities like Tom Brady and Larry David. He repeatedly emphasized to customers that their money was safe and secure. But “all of that, all of it, was built on lies,” Rehn declared to the jury. “Behind the curtains, he was not what he appeared to be.” What followed was a roughly 30-minute story that repeatedly emphasized how Bankman-Fried allegedly stole customer funds to facilitate his jet-setting lifestyle, donate millions to political candidates, and finance risky bets. The key to his alleged scheme? Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he also owned, argued Rehn. Using Caroline Ellison, his on-again off-again girlfriend and the CEO of Alameda, as a front, Bankman-Fried had “secret access” to customer money—both cash and crypto—the government claimed. Moreover, Bankman-Fried allegedly directed employees to conceal the flow of money into FTX’s coffers and forged financial documents distributed to lenders and investors. “The defendant lied to the world,” Rehn alleged. And who was this defendant? Not a crypto “boy” genius, as so many in the media (Fortune included) have written, but a “man” who “stole billions of dollars from thousands of victims,” Rehn said. “You will see the full picture.” But Bankman-Fried, whose cheekbones were more prominent after spending about seven weeks in a Brooklyn prison, was no liar, according to Mark Cohen, one of his lawyers. “Sam didn’t defraud anyone,” he said early on in his opening statement. What the jury will see is a nerdy startup founder who acted in “good faith,” not the prosecution’s “cartoon of a villain.” (Cohen repeatedly harped on Bankman-Fried’s allegedly good-faith actions throughout his address to the jury.) Alameda was not subterranean or shady. It was a successful hedge fund, he said. FTX was no Ponzi scheme. It was a “very innovative, successful company.” And the business practices between the two were reasonable, he argued, claiming that Alameda acted legally as an FTX customer, payment processor, and market maker, or financial entity that acts as a trading partner for customers looking to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. In an analogy he employed throughout his opening statement, he said that “working at a startup is like building a plane as you’re flying it” and that businesses sometimes fail. In fact, he specifically pointed the finger at Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, who, he said, did not adequately protect her hedge fund from the inherent risk of the crypto markets. When the walls came closing in and the aforementioned plane approached the “eye of the storm,” Bankman-Fried did not act like someone who was guilty. Rather, he was willing to give up his personal wealth to make customers whole, Cohen argued. “In the end, Sam started and built two billion-dollar businesses,” he concluded. “He didn’t steal any money.” After lawyers from both sides depicted two very different Bankman-Frieds, the prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand—and they weren’t blockbuster names or former lieutenants-turned-government-cooperators, like Ellison. The first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London. In 2021, Julliard, who had coiffed hair and spoke with a strong French accent, decided to invest in crypto and landed on FTX as his exchange of choice, where he traded cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. On Nov. 8, in the crypto exchange’s final few days, he tried to pull out his cash and crypto. How much? Almost $100,000, he said. And was he ever able to? “Never,” he told prosecutors. Shortly afterward, as the trial neared late afternoon, the government called Adam Yedidia to the stand. A fast-talking graduate of MIT, he and Bankman-Fried were close friends in college, he said. And after Bankman-Fried left Jane Street, the high-frequency trading firm where the former billionaire got his start in finance after MIT, he persuaded Yedidia to join him as a trader at Alameda and then as a developer at FTX. When Yedidia first took the stand, Danielle Sassoon, one of the lead prosecutors, said that the college friend of Bankman-Fried had legal immunity during his testimony. Why did he make such a deal with the government, she asked. “I was concerned that I had unwittingly written code that contributed to a crime,” he said. Soon, however, the clock neared 4:30 p.m., and court adjourned for the day. Yedidia will continue his testimony on Thursday, followed by Matt Huang, a former partner at the high-powered venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and then Gary Wang, a key Bankman-Fried lieutenant and one of the government’s star witnesses. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Elizabeth Lopatto: Sam Bankman-Fried sat motionless during the prosecution's opening statement. She says the defense used a metaphor to explain what happened at FTX. But she says if FTX was a plane, it was flying with a key component missing: a risk officer. She asks: Why didn't the prosecution mention the missing risk officer in the opening statement? LOPatto: BankmanFried is unlikely to have been stupid or deliberately worried about what one might find out about his company if he didn't hire a risk Officer. The trial is expected to last two weeks. The jury will decide whether or not to convict him on charges of fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud. The prosecution is seeking a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

        <p  class="element-article">By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.  I have never seen Sam Bankman-Fried so still as he was during the prosecution’s opening statement. The characteristic leg-jiggling was absent. He barely moved as the prosecutor listed the evidence against him: internal company files, what customers were told, the testimony of his co-conspirators and his own words. His hair was shorn, the result of a haircut from a fellow prisoner, the Wall Street Journal reported. He wore a suit bought at a discount at Macy’s, per the Journal; it hung on him. He appeared to have lost some weight. “All of that was built on lies.” Bankman-Fried, at this time last year, had a luxury lifestyle as the CEO of crypto exchange FTX, said the assistant US attorney, Thane Rehn, in the cadence of a high schooler delivering his lines in a student play. Bankman-Fried hung out with Tom Brady. He was on magazine covers, lived in a $30 million penthouse, and spent time with world politicians. “All of that was built on lies,” Rehn said. In his opening statement, Rehn dodged explaining cryptocurrency to the jury. Instead, he punched hard on Bankman-Fried lying and stealing.  Bankman-Fried sat almost motionless, occasionally glancing at Rehn, as the prosecutor told the jury that Bankman-Fried sold stock in FTX and borrowed millions from lenders by lying.  The story Rehn told is familiar to anyone following the news. In May and June of 2022, Alameda Research — the crypto trading company ostensibly helmed by Caroline Ellison — didn’t have enough to pay its bills, so it pulled customer money to repay loans. By September, the hole in the FTX balance sheet was so big that customers could never be repaid. FTX “didn’t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.” When CoinDesk published its article in November 2022, people realized FTX was a house of cards, Rehn said. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried tweeted. “FTX is fine. Assets are fine” and “We don’t invest customer assets even in treasuries.” Pointing at Bankman-Fried, Rehn said, “This man stole billions of dollars from thousands of people.”  So how was the defense going to follow it up? I was very curious, having learned yesterday that Bankman-Fried had never been offered a plea deal since he and his attorneys had told the government they wouldn’t negotiate. Surely there would be some manner of evidence, some something, that would have made him so confident. There was, instead, a metaphor. Defense attorney Mark Cohen, with the energy of a patient father telling his obnoxious children a bedtime story, assured us that working at a startup was like building a plane while flying it, and that FTX the plane had flown right into the perfect storm: the crypto crash. Except, uh, he also said this: FTX “didn’t have a chief risk officer, which became an issue when the storm hit.” I couldn’t stop thinking about the missing risk officer The problem with this metaphor is that if FTX was a plane, it was a plane flying with a key component missing — namely, the risk officer, an executive whose job it is to, well, manage risk. This is sort of an important thing, as risks can be anything from reputational to regulatory to financial.  FTX was named such as it was because it was a futures exchange, which, to borrow a phrase from Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, “sits between the winners and losers of bets.” That means FTX can’t pay out what it owes the winners unless the losers pay up. Risk management is a crucial part of the business; risk officers exist to identify business’ potential risks, monitor, and mitigate them. This is to say nothing of the regulatory risks around crypto.  As Cohen droned on about airplanes, I couldn’t stop thinking about the missing risk officer. Bringing it up, I thought, was a tremendous mistake. The prosecution hadn’t mentioned it. Either Bankman-Fried is stupid — unlikely — or he deliberately didn’t hire a risk officer. Was he worried about what one might find?  Sure, as Cohen put it, Bankman-Fried was a math nerd who didn’t party. That paints a picture of someone who’s pretty deliberate, particularly since he immediately left MIT and went to work on Wall Street. If he had been a party-hardy trainwreck, I could see overlooking a risk officer in order to do another line, or a supermodel, or something else important. Why was the defense bringing this up? But as Cohen tried to tell me that FTX’s and Alameda’s business relationships were “reasonable under the circumstances,” the lack of risk officer kept elbowing me in the ribs. “Sam acted in good faith and took reasonable business measures” is a pretty hard pill to swallow with that in mind.  Man, it’s no good when your defense lawyer has just made you sound worse than the prosecution already did. And while Cohen tried to make the common white-collar defense argument that Bankman-Fried, as CEO, was simply too busy to oversee what everyone did every day, he just made me more suspicious. That’s why you hire a risk officer and delegate! That’s the whole point! I could barely even hear Cohen blaming Caroline Ellison and Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for the debacle over the “no risk officer” ringing in my ears. Following the defense’s opening statements, things got still worse for Bankman-Fried. The prosecution called its first witness, Marc-Antoine Julliard, whose money got stuck on FTX. Juilliard, who was born in Paris and lives in London, testified that he trusted FTX because Bankman-Fried came across as a leading figure of the industry. When he was evaluating the exchange, he thought the sheer volume of users was important, too — at the time, FTX was among the top three biggest exchanges. Plus, major VC firms had invested, and “they don’t commit hundreds of millions without doing due diligence, checking the books, the accountancy of the firm, going through several compliance process[es], so that was a vote of confidence for me,” Juilliard said. (Evidently he had not paid attention to the Elizabeth Holmes trial.) He also noted FTX’s glossy ads — featuring Gisele Bündchen, for instance —  suggested a very high budget. It wouldn’t make sense to spend that much money unless FTX had very strong financials, Juilliard figured. He opened an account, transferred in both regular money and cryptocurrency, and used the exchange to execute his plan: buying Bitcoin to sell back in five to ten years at higher prices. It is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone  In November 2022, things went bad for Julliard. He followed Bankman-Fried on Twitter, and read aloud the “FTX is fine. Assets are fine” tweets, along with “FTX has enough to cover all client holdings. We don’t invest client assets” and a few others, which gave Julliard the impression that his money was there — the problem might have been technical (anti-spam measures) or regulatory. When he tried to get his money out on November 8th, it was too late. We saw screenshots of his withdrawal attempts: $20,000 USD and about 4 Bitcoin, which were worth about $20,000 at the time: about $100,000 money, inaccessible. It is a thankless task to cross-examine a customer whose money is gone, but Cohen tried anyway. He noted that Julliard was a licensed commodities broker, who was trading in crypto because he didn’t have to disclose it; that Julliard knew that crypto was new and risky, and that Julliard didn’t review the terms of service agreement he’d assented to when making his FTX account.  Well, sure, but so what?  The next witness called was Bankman-Fried’s former college (and FTX) roommate, Adam Yedidia, about whom I expect I will have much more to say tomorrow.  When the jury was dismissed, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers told the judge that he wasn’t getting his full Adderall doses in prison. The defense appeared to be setting up the grounds for an appeal — it’s previously argued that the prison withholding Adderall made it difficult for Bankman-Fried to prepare his defense. Given what I saw today, setting up an appeal seems wise. It is, at minimum, risk management.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Costco's 1-ounce gold bars have sold out faster than discounted laundry detergent. The gold bars, sold exclusively online, are “typically gone within a few hours” of appearing on Costco’s website. As of Wednesday, they remained sold out. Gold for December delivery fell $6.70 to $1,834.80 an ounce by market close Wednesday. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has warned people to be wary of investing in gold because prices rise as demand goes up, and sellers profit from the demand for precious metals. But some experts say gold can diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate potential risks down the road. It's important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits.</p>

        <p  class="element-article">Looking for something to add to your Costco cart along with the 30 rolls of toilet paper? How about a bar of gold? While not a typical outlet for the sale of precious metals, the members-only warehouse chain has seen its 1-ounce gold bars sell out faster than discounted 170-ounce jugs of laundry detergent. In a company earnings call last week, CFO Richard Galanti said the gold bars, sold exclusively online, are “typically gone within a few hours” of appearing on Costco’s website — adding that there’s a two-bar limit per member. As of Wednesday, they remained sold out. Unlike some other discount finds at the retail giant, gold bars come with hefty price tag. No prices were listed Wednesday because of the bars’ unavailability, but multiple media outlets reported last week that the 1-ounce gold pieces — offered in two designs — were selling for just below $2,000 each. That’s slightly higher than the current market price of gold, which stood at about $1,835 per ounce Wednesday afternoon. Costco did not specify how many gold bars have been sold recently, or how often it restocks them. The chain based in Issaquah, Washington, did not immediately respond to The Associated Press’ request for comment Wednesday. Chances are, interest around Costco’s gold bars isn’t going away anytime soon. Although one or two ounces of gold won’t have a huge impact on diversifying one’s investment portfolio, experts note that there’s been increasing investor demand for precious metals in recent years, and that’s likely to continue. Still, it’s important to pause and evaluate investment prospects. Here’s what some experts say.  Interest in buying gold often stems from feelings of uncertainty, experts say. Jonathan Rose, CEO of precious metal broker Genesis Gold Group, says that recent bank failures, inflation and individuals’ concerns about the U.S. dollar, for example, can cause some to start looking for alternative places to park their money. “If someone’s going out to buy gold, that means they think that there’s some type of instability at the structural level of the market and/or the government itself,” added David Wagner III, head of markets and equities at Aptus Capital Advisors. Rose and others say gold can diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate potential risks down the road. “People are looking for a safe haven … to protect their wealth. And gold kind of ticks all those boxes,” Rose said. He added that people may see value in having something tangible — and put precious metals “in a safety deposit box or into a retirement plan, even like an IRA or 401k … to safeguard what they have whilst they see what’s happening in the market.” But not everyone agrees. Wagner says gold is “one of the worst things that you can ever own.” Among the downsides, he argues, is that gold isn’t the inflationary hedge many say it is, with inflation at times outpacing gold in recent decades, and that “there are more efficient ways to protect against the loss of capital,” such as through derivative-based investments. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up — meaning “when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.” If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission and others add, it’s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market. Gold for December delivery fell $6.70 to $1,834.80 an ounce by market close Wednesday. For other precious metals, silver for December delivery fell 23 cents to $21.15 an ounce and December copper fell 3 cents to $3.59 a pound. © 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        <p class="element">Summary </p>
        <p>Amp, the live radio app launched by Amazon just last year, will soon be no more. Bloomberg reports that Steve Boom, the vice president of Amazon Music, sent a memo announcing the shutdown. “This decision was not made quickly or easily,” Boom wrote, according to Bloomberg.

The Verge has reached out to both Amp and Amazon Music for more details on when the service will officially sunset.

        <p  class="element-article">By  Amrita Khalid, one of the authors of audio industry newsletter Hot Pod. Khalid has covered tech, surveillance policy, consumer gadgets, and online communities for more than a decade.  Amp, the live radio app launched by Amazon just last year, will soon be no more. Bloomberg reports that Steve Boom, the vice president of Amazon Music, sent a memo announcing the shutdown. The Amp app still appears to be available for download and is still airing live radio shows as of the time of publication. The Verge has reached out to both Amp and Amazon Music for more details on when the service will officially sunset.  “This decision was not made quickly or easily,” Boom wrote, according to Bloomberg. “It only became clear after months of careful consideration determining the investments Amazon wants to make for the future.” Amazon’s experiment in live audio only lasted about a year and a half — the app was first launched in March 2022 and seemed to be a competitor to Clubhouse and other live or social audio services launched during the pandemic. But unlike Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, which allowed anyone to launch a live chat room on any topic, Amp was geared toward fans of music and talk radio. Any Amp user with an Amazon account could launch a live show and access millions of licensed songs, which they could compile into playlists and play for their followers. Amp users could “call in” to shows and ask hosts questions.  Amp pulled in musicians, comedians, podcasters, athletes, and other celebrities to host shows during its height — with the likes of Nicki Minaj, Jason Lee, Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors, Joe Budden, Guy Raz of How I Built This, Pusha T, and others appearing for live programs on the service. But signs of trouble became apparent early on. Amazon cut half of Amp’s existing staff last year, amounting to roughly 150 employees.  Amp’s closure is the latest in the line of live audio services shuttering or pivoting after users have dropped off after the pandemic. Last month, Clubhouse announced it was reinventing itself as a group messaging app. Spotify also shut down its live audio feature earlier this year. In response to questions from The Verge, Amazon Music spokesperson Rebecca Silverstein provided the following statement: “We’ve made the difficult decision to close Amp. In creating Amp, we tried something that had never been done before and built a product that gave creators a place where they could build genuine connections with each other, and share a common love for music. We learned a lot about how live music communities interact in the process, which we are bringing to bear as we build new fan experiences at scale in Amazon Music.”   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.
