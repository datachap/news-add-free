            <p>Filed under: By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Google has launched the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel Watch 2 following a steady stream of leaks — plus Google’s own teasers — that left little to the imagination. The Pixel 8 Pro has better cameras and a brighter screen to go with a starting price of $999. Meanwhile, the standard Pixel 8 has a slightly smaller 6.2-inch display compared to its predecessor. Both phones share Google’s new Tensor G3 chipset, as well as Android 14 out of the box and a promise of seven years of OS upgrades, and are available for preorders starting today. The Pixel Watch 2 has some design changes, too, and is available for preorder starting at $349. There’s a new crown and updated sensor array, plus some features carried over from the Fitbit Sense 2.  You can follow along with all the latest news from the Pixel 8 launch event below or jump straight to the biggest announcements. Oct 5 Richard Lawler and Allison Johnson Allison Johnson has our first impressions of Google’s new flagships, the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, with their new Tensor G3 chipsets, Android 14, seven years of updates, and, as we heard during the Made by Google event on Wednesday, all of the AI you can fit in a phone. Oct 4 Richard Lawler and Victoria Song Victoria Song walks you through everything that’s new about the Pixel Watch 2, like its new sensors and promise of longer battery life. The wearable was fully revealed earlier today during Google’s big Pixel 8 event along with the new phones, Android 14, and lots of AI-powered features. Oct 4 Richard Lawler Enterprise IT teams have a few new options for workers with devices running Android 14, as Google’s blog post mentions a default screen lock PIN that has increased from four to six, the ability for admins to allow only approved credential managers to store login info, the ability to block potentially insecure 2G connections, and logs for ultra wideband. Now that the new OS has launched along with the Pixel 8 family of devices, Android 14 can make it easier to select certain profiles for certain apps, switch between profiles, and save work-related screenshots directly to the work profile only. Oct 4 Emma Roth Google is rolling out Android 14 to Pixel 4A 5G devices and up. You can view the full list of fixes coming this month to all supported Pixel devices from the link below. [support.google.com] Oct 4 Sheena Vasani In addition to officially rolling out Android 14, Google introduced the Pixel Watch 2 and a new lineup of phones during its Made by Google Event on Wednesday. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro start at $699 and $999, respectively, and will be available on October 12th. On the spec front, both phones sport Google’s new Tensor G3 chip, which is an upgrade over the G2 chip that marked Google’s Pixel 7 lineup. Each also comes with a 120Hz max refresh rate and seven years of software support and security updates. The Pro 8 touts a maximum of 1TB of storage as well, along with a new sensor for measuring the temperature of beverages, surfaces, and — perhaps one day — maybe even people.  Oct 4 Antonio G. Di Benedetto Last year’s Pixel 7 phones were an iterative spec bump and nice refinement in the design department (as polarizing as their looks remained), but part of what made those phones special was how much they offered for fairly competitive prices.  Now, Google has announced the $699 Pixel 8 and $999 Pixel 8 Pro (which are $100 price increases over last year’s phones), each due to arrive on October 12th, and once again, they look a lot like a slow burn of subtle hardware improvements — albeit in a slick new light-blue color option on the Pro. But the showstopper feature of the new Pixels may be Google’s software support, as it’s claiming the new phones will see seven whole years of OS and security updates — rivaling Apple’s reign as the longest-lasting phones.  Oct 4 Richard Lawler The biggest announcements from today’s Made by Google event for the release of the Pixel 8 phones, Pixel Watch 2, Android 14, and a slew of new generative AI features coming to Photos, Assistant, and more are all right here. Oct 4 Sean Hollister Bluetooth Super Wideband is only for Pixel 8 and newer — it’s in the fine print.  Oct 4 Jon Porter During an onstage presentation at today’s Pixel 8 Pro launch, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh showed off how the smartphone is able to retroactively add detail to a photograph when you pinch to zoom in. “So the kind of zoom enhancement you used to see in science fiction? It’s right in the phone in your hand,” Osterloh said after introducing the feature, which Google is calling “Zoom Enhance.” Osterloh is referring, of course, to the countless sci-fi movies and police procedural shows that have shown characters zooming impossibly far into photos to reveal clues and details that simply could not have been present in the original image. Often, these scenes hinge on “enhancing” unbelievably small reflections, inevitably revealing the identity of a murder suspect. Oct 4 Emma Roth During the Made by Google event, where it debuted new Pixel 8 and Pixel Watch 2 hardware, Google also announced it’s launching Assistant with Bard, which leverages generative AI to provide personalized assistance to users. The company says the new AI-enhanced assistant can do things like help plan your next trip, find details in your email inbox, and even create a grocery list. Just like Bard on the web, Assistant with Bard will integrate with some of the company’s existing apps, such as Gmail and Docs, to help you find and summarize information. Additionally, you can interact with the tool through text, voice, or images, and it will still retain some of Assistant’s key features that allow you to do things like send a text message. Oct 4 Emma Roth Google’s latest Pixel launch event has come to an end. Even though some of the products Google revealed were leaked well in advance, the company still managed to throw in a couple of surprises. Here are all the biggest announcements from the Made by Google event. Oct 4 Sean Hollister Wi-Fi 7 is limited to the US, CA, UK, EU, and AU for now.  For both phones, the “Beyond 24-hour battery life” claim is tested “across a mix of talk, data, standby, and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 31 hours.”  Here’s Google’s spec comparison page, too. [support.google.com] Oct 4 Sean Hollister Click to enhance. Oct 4 Sean Hollister  Oct 4 Sean Hollister  Oct 4 Victoria Song Big, big, big round of applause as Osterloh says support for the Pixel 8 will continue until 2030. We’re wrapping up at the Made By Google event now. Allison and I are about to go run and get some hands-on time with all these new gadgets!  Oct 4 Sean Hollister I have a Pixel 6A that’s almost solely for Google Recorder, an incredible tool for journalists due to great real-time transcription. AI summaries... would they be useful? Exclusive to the Pro, apparently.  Oct 4 Allison Johnson Pixel 8 starts at $699, and Pixel 8 Pro is $999. They’re available for preorder today and on shelves next week. See all our Google Pixel event live coverage. Oct 4 Victoria Song A lot of the cool stuff we’re seeing here today isn’t coming at launch. You’ll have to wait for future updates coming in December.  Oct 4 Allison Johnson Yep, there’s a new feature called Zoom Enhance on the Pixel 8 Pro. It uses on-device processing to let you zoom in on parts of your photos and recreates fine detail. Like in the movies! It’s available in December via Feature Drop. Oct 4 Allison Johnson The phone can run up to 150x more computations than the largest model on Pixel 7. Magic Eraser looks like it gets a big improvement from this on-device processing, too. It’s available right away, says Rick. See all our Google Pixel event live coverage Oct 4 Victoria Song After all that Assistant with Bard barrage, Rick Osterloh is back onstage to give us a highlight reel of everything coming to Pixel. He’s showing off a demo of the Pixel phones creating summaries of long articles. He’s also saying the Pixel phones are the first to run foundation models directly on the device.  Oct 4 Sheena Vasani Google announced the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro on Wednesday during its Made by Google Event, introducing it alongside the new Pixel Watch 2. Both phones will be available on October 12th starting at $699 and $999, respectively, with preorders beginning today, October 4th. Powered by the new Google Tensor G3, both phones should offer improved performance, audio, and voice quality. The chip also allows for new AI capabilities, like Audio Magic Eraser, which removes distracting sounds from videos. In addition, both phones now feature a max refresh rate of 120Hz and the promise of seven years of software support and Android updates. The Pro model, meanwhile, offers improved cameras and additional bells and whistles, like the ability to measure the temperature of objects. Oct 4 Allison Johnson It’s coming to select testers first, then they’ll be expanding availability in the next few months. Also, it wrote a social caption for a cute puppy photo. Oct 4 Allison Johnson Google is shouting out its AI chatbot while we’re talking about Google Assistant. Sissie Hsiao is introducing Assistant with Bard, which will offer more generative capabilities. It can find your important emails and pull together information from different apps.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

They have since slightly pared losses, having resumed again trading shortly after 9:00 a.m. London time. The London Stock Exchange, which lists the stock, confirmed to CNBC that the brief suspensions were triggered by its circuit breaker mechanisms because of the extent of the volatile drop. The halts followed reports that the bank was trying to raise £600 million ($727 million) in debt and equity, according to Reuters. The challenger bank, which launched in 2010, has a market cap of less than £100 million. Metro Bank said in a statement that it is currently considering "how best to enhance its capital resources," with a particular focus on a £350 million bond due to mature in October 2025. Investors traded more than 1.6 million shares immediately after the stock market opened Thursday, according to FactSet. Typically, less than 100,000 Metro Bank shares change hands every hour. Shares of the bank have lost around two thirds of their value since the middle of February. Metro Bank was valued at £87 million as of the Wednesday close, according to Reuters. Last mont, the Bank of England's main regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, suggested that it was unlikely to allow the lender to use its own internal risk models for some mortgages. As such, the Metro Bank would be subject to higher capital requirements — a concern that has weighed on investors. "It has been clear for some time that [Metro] is short of capital, with the bank operating below MREL requirements," investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a research note, referring to minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities enforced by authorities. The key questions now facing the bank center on its ability to raise that capital and whether that will be sufficient to remove capital concerns, the note said. — CNBC's Ganesh Rao contributed to this report.
