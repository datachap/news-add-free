Most Read from Bloomberg Israel Latest: Over 1,100 Dead; US Sends Warships to Region Israel Latest: Army Reserves Called Up, Chevron Shuts Gas Field Oil Surges as Israel Conflict Reignites Middle East Volatility As Israel-Hamas War Rages, Oil Traders Focus on Iran Israelis Taken Hostage Were Ripped From Everyday Activities Crude traders don\u2019t expect a massive price surge as there\u2019s no immediate threat to supply. But all eyes are on Iran, a major oil producer and key backer of the Hamas group that launched this weekend\u2019s offensive on Israel. A retaliatory strike against the Islamic Republic would inflame fears over the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping artery which Tehran has previously threatened to close. There\u2019s also the prospect of the US cracking down again on a resurgent flow of Iranian oil exports. \u201cIran remains a very big wild card,\u201d said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets and a former CIA analyst. \u201cIsrael will escalate its long-running shadow war against Iran\u201d and \u201cwhat is unpredictable is how Iran would respond to such an intensification.\u201d The risk of a wider conflict has emerged just as global crude supplies have been depleted by months of sharp production cutbacks by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Last month their supply constraints briefly pushed Brent futures to almost $100 a barrel. \u201cIt is unlikely to impact oil supply in the short term,\u201d said hedge fund trader Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP. \u201cBut it could eventually have an impact on supply and prices.\u201d The onslaught comes almost exactly 50 years after the Arab oil embargo, when Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers choked off flows to the west in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which also involved Israel. READ: For Oil, It\u2019s Not 1973. But It Could Still Get Ugly: Javier Blas No one expects Riyadh \u2014 which has been negotiating with Washington over normalizing relations with Israel \u2014 to turn off the taps in solidarity with the Palestinians now. At worst, the conflict may derail the normalization talks and scupper any additional Saudi oil flows that may have resulted. The energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, a key OPEC member, was clear on Sunday that the conflict wouldn\u2019t affect the group\u2019s decision-making. \u201cWe do not engage in politics; we govern by supply and demand, and we do not consider what each country has done,\u201d Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told reporters in Riyadh. For its part, Iran, also an OPEC member, has expressed support for the Palestinian attack. Israel Latest: Fighting Extends to Second Day, Stocks Plunge If Israel responds by striking any Iranian infrastructure, \u201ccrude prices would immediately spike on the perceived risk of a disruption,\u201d said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. For now, that looks unlikely, he said. Iranian oil has become increasingly important to the market as shipments have rebounded to a five-year high. That has come with Washington\u2019s tacit blessing as the two sides have engaged in tentative diplomacy to re-establish limits on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. This weekend\u2019s hostilities could prompt President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to deal more aggressively with those cargo flows, which mostly go to China. \u201cI think this development will mean stronger enforcement of Iranian sanctions, so less Iranian oil going forward,\u201d said Andurand. \u201cAnd then who knows what the domino effect will be in the region?\u201d In a more extreme scenario, Iran could respond to any direct provocation by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a nautical choke-point just north of the Arabian Sea. Tankers haul nearly 17 million barrels of crude and condensate each day through the waterway, which at its narrowest point is just 21 miles wide. Tehran threatened to close the strait when sanctions were imposed on the country in 2011, but ultimately backed off. The swelling tide of Iranian barrels has helped to moderate fuel prices this year while the Saudis and Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia squeeze supplies. The joint Riyadh-Moscow action is draining oil inventories at the fastest pace in years, installing a hefty price premium on prompt supplies known in the industry as backwardation. The \u201ccrude market is very tight\u201d as \u201cphysical markets are screaming, with backwardation heading higher, dragging the flat price higher,\u201dsaid Gary Ross, a veteran oil consultant turned hedge fund manager at Black Gold Investors LLC. Last week brought signs that the push toward $100 had gone too far, as Brent slumped 11% to just under $85 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Production cuts by the Saudis and Russia may have juiced prices too high, exacerbating jitters over the economy and bolstering the risk of higher interest rates. On the other hand, slashing output to about 9 million barrels a day has given Riyadh an immense buffer of spare production capacity that could be deployed if the current crisis leads to a disruption. The kingdom has about 3 million barrels day in reserve, and neighboring United Arab Emirates has another 1 million, according to Bloomberg estimates. That prodigious safety cushion of idle capacity is another reason traders don\u2019t expect an immediate price surge when markets reopen. Still, the events may restore some of the geopolitical risk premium that had melted away in recent years. \u201cThe Hamas strike and Israeli response raises the geopolitical temperature,\u201d said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd. --With assistance from Fahad Abuljadayel, Salma El Wardany and Anthony Di Paola.

The survey also noted that among those Americans who supported his ouster, 75% agreed with the sentiment that McCarthy wasn\u2019t effective, an opinion that came after McCarthy cut a deal to avert a government shutdown last month, angering many of the members of the right flank of his party. Notably, 54% of Americans who identified as conservative expressed approval for ousting McCarthy, while 70% of Americans who called themselves liberals backed the move. Last Tuesday, Democrats joined with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and his small group of conservative allies to vote to strip McCarthy of his gavel.  The development has thrust the House into a new era of chaos, especially with the specter of another government shutdown just weeks away. House Republicans are expected to meet this coming week to figure out a way forward. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) has officially announced he would pursue the speakership, while former President Donald Trump has endorsed Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who also formally expressed his bid. It sets up a potentially messy battle to replace McCarthy, who has said he would not pursue another shot at the top job in the House.

The US said it\u2019s moving a six-vessel aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean and is augmenting its fighter aircraft squadrons in the region. More than 700 Israelis, most of them civilians, were killed in the attacks which erupted outside the Gaza Strip on Saturday morning. About 400 Palestinians have died in fighting and retaliatory attacks, as the Israeli military regained control over most areas breached by militants. The operation by Hamas \u2014 which included taking scores of Israeli hostages \u2014 was an unprecedented incursion that has shaken regional stability and markets. Israel officially declared war and says it won\u2019t stop until Hamas\u2019s military infrastructure is dismantled, a task that seems likely to include a ground invasion and take months. All time stamps Israel. \u201cA good number of countries\u201d condemned the Hamas attacks during a closed session of the UN Security Council, Ambassador Robert Wood of the US said. \u201cObviously not all. I don\u2019t really want to get into that. I think you could probably figure out one of them without me saying anything.\u201d Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh of the UAE said the immediate concern is the safe and unconditional return of hostages; broader political discussions aimed at a possible two-state solution can be addressed later. Iranian security officials helped Hamas plan its attack on Israel in a series of meetings over months, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group and political faction in Lebanon. The Journal said Hamas was given the \u201cgreen light\u201d for the attack in Beirut last Monday. US officials have noted Iran\u2019s longstanding support for Hamas, with money and weapons. But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday the US hasn\u2019t \u201cyet seen direct evidence that Iran was behind this particular attack.\u201d The dollar climbed against its major peers in early trading on Monday as currency traders got their first chance to react to a shock attack by Hamas within Israel. The greenback \u2014 long regarded as a haven in times of trouble \u2014 rose versus the euro and pound as trading began in Sydney, while riskier currencies including its Australian counterpart slipped. The yen \u2014 another favored refuge for investors \u2014 rallied. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian observer at the United Nations, took a defiant tone in comments to reporters ahead of a special Security Council session, saying his people had repeatedly warned the Security Council about \u201cthe consequences of Israeli impunity and international inaction.\u201d \u201cWe know only too well that the messages about Israel\u2019s right to defend itself will be interpreted by Israel as license to kill, to pursue on the very path that led us here,\u201d Mansour said. Palestinian Islamic Jihad is holding more than 30 Israeli hostages that will not be freed until all Islamic Jihad prisoners in Israel are also freed, the group\u2019s leader, Ziad Al-Nakhala, said in a televised address. Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said \u201cevery inch of Gaza has become part of Hamas\u2019 war machine,\u201d vowing that his country would \u201cobliterate\u201d all of the group\u2019s terror infrastructure. Despite the violence, Israel is sticking to efforts to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia, he said, charging that suspending that bid would only benefit Iran. \u201cThere are moderate countries in our region that want to normalize relations and live in peace and coexistence, and definitely Saudi Arabia is part of them,\u201d he said, speaking to reporters before a closed-door session of the UN Security Council on the issue. At least four American citizens were killed in the attacks on Israel, the Associated Press reported, citing preliminary reports from an unnamed US official. A six-vessel US naval group including the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is headed to the eastern Mediterranean to \u201cbolster regional deterrence efforts,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. Additional US equipment and resources, including munitions, will arrive in the coming days, he said. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone for the second time in two days. Biden told Netanyahu during the call that additional military assistance for Israel \u201cis now on its way,\u201d according to a White House statement. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reiterated his call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. \u201cThe basis of the problems in our region today is the Palestine issue. Unless the issue is resolved, the region will long for peace,\u201d Erdogan said in Istanbul on Sunday, \u201cIt is important to preserve the two-state solution.\u201d Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant instructed officials to prepare for the evacuation of civilians from communities in the country\u2019s north. The program would be similar to evacuations that have taken place in more than 20 communities adjacent to the Gaza Strip. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US is \u201cworking very actively\u201d to verify reports that \u201cseveral Americans\u201d are among the dead. \u201cAt the same time, there are reports of Americans being taken hostage. There too, we\u2019re working to get the facts and find out if those reports are accurate,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. Netanyahu spoke with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Sunday. All four expressed unreserved support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, Netanyahu said. Iran\u2019s President Ebrahim Raisi spoke with leaders of the militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad and \u201creviewed the situation underway in the occupied lands,\u201d the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency said. Muslim governments should support the Palestinian people, Raisi said. \u201cThe hostile Israelis should know the equations have changed. Iran supports the legitimate defense of the Palestinian people.\u201d While Israel has said it suspects Iran is involved, Tehran has not explicitly said it aided the attacks. Blinken has said there\u2019s no immediate evidence Iran directed the attack.Link \u2014 With assistance by Stuart Wallace, Natalia Drozdiak, Dana Khraiche, Ethan Bronner, Gwen Ackerman, Fadwa Hodali, Tony Czuczka, Susanne Barton, Selcan Hacaoglu, Arsalan Shahla, Marie Patino, Albertina Torsoli, Victoria Cavaliere, Galit Altstein, Gregory White, and Courtney McBride  \u00a9 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.
